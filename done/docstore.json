In the end, Palin offered her daughter Bristol as a babysitter for Fey\u2019s 3-year-old daughter, and Fey got her husband\u2019s parents and sister tickets to a Palin rally.\\n\\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t want to have to do the impression at the same time with her,\u201d Fey told me. \u201cOne, it would shine a light on the inaccuracies of the impression, and two, it\u2019s just always \u2014 the only word I can think of is \u2018sweaty.\u2019\u201d\\n\\nDonald Trump had clowned around with two of his \u201cS.N.L.\u201d impersonators, Darrell Hammond and Taran Killam, during his monologue when he hosted the show in 2015 (a night that left many cast members torn about whether they were helping Trump).
