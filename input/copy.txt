Now, Republicans have officially taken control of Congress and his "promises" are a whole lot easier to keep. In Washington political parlance, it\'s called "a governing trifecta", when the president\'s party also controls both chambers of Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate. That control is what Donald Trump\'s Republican Party now has. Single-party control was once common, but in recent decades it has become rarer and shorter. Often, the party in power loses seats when midterm congressional elections roll around two years later. Both Trump and Joe Biden enjoyed trifectas for their first two years in the White House, but they also saw that having such control is no guarantee a president can get their way.\n\nSeven things Trump says he will do in power\n\nWhen does he become president again?\n\nWhat happens to his legal cases now\n\nHow he pulled off an incredible comeback In his first two years, Trump passed a signature tax bill - reducing corporate taxes from 35% to 21%, and cutting some taxes on individuals. But with some members of his own party resistant to his surprise ascent to the top in 2016, he struggled with other aims. His plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) failed when a senator from his own party, John McCain, refused to vote for it. He also failed to pass an infrastructure bill as he had promised. In his first two years, when the Democrats controlled the House and the Senate, Biden succeeded in passing the American Rescue plan, the Investment and Jobs Act, and the Chips and Science Act. But he, too, had to significantly scale back his sending and investment plans - touted as the Build Back Better package - after opposition from one of his own senators. A major impediment to total control for either party is that Senate bills require a three-fifths majority, or 60 votes, to bypass the filibuster, which enables senators to delay legislation by keeping debate open-ended. That means that when a party has a simple majority in the Senate, it needs to reach across the aisle to get a bill passed.'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Kianoosh Sanjari: Activist takes own life in protest at Iranian regime', 'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg0qz157yyo', 'authors': [], 'language': 'en', 'description': "Kianoosh Sanjari was an outspoken critic of Iran's leaders and had demanded the release of political prisoners.", 'publish_date': None, 'feed': 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml'}, page_content='Activist takes own life in protest at Iranian regime\n\n"My life will end after this tweet," he wrote at 19:20, adding: "I wish that one day Iranians will wake up and overcome slavery."\n\nWhen authorities did not free the prisoners, he posted an image taken from high up overlooking a busy junction in the capital Tehran on X.\n\nIn a post on social media, Kianoosh Sanjari said he would take his own life if four political prisoners were not released by 19:00 local time (16:30 BST) on Wednesday.\n\nA well-known Iranian human rights activist has killed himself in protest at what he called the dictatorship of Iran\'s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\n"No one should be imprisoned for expressing their opinions.\n\n"Protest is the right of every Iranian citizen."\n\nHis death was confirmed hours later by fellow activists.\n\nSanjari was a vocal critic of Iran\'s leaders and advocate for democracy.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, he posted the ultimatum on X.\n\n"If Fateme Sepehari, Nasreen Shakrami, Tomaj Salehi and Arsham Rezaei are not released from prison by 19:00 today ...

It was supposed to have been cleared. They had found eight bodies - including three children and three women - and taken the many injured to hospitals; some were in a critical condition. Then several men on a balcony in a building opposite started shouting: “A hand, a hand. We can see a hand.” They were pointing at a balcony on the second floor, which was completely destroyed and had crumbled on to the collapsed floor below. A young man climbed on to the mound of rubble. He reached the spot, moved some of the rubble, then held something up that could not be identified from distance. Later, I asked him if he did find a hand. He replied: “No. It wasn’t a hand. It was a piece of bone from a head.”\n\nThe multi-storey building that was hit is located in a residential area. We were told that most of the people there were internally displaced, mainly from the south of the country or the southern suburbs of Beirut. They are areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence and which have been frequently targeted by Israel during its war with the Iran-backed political and military group. Aramoun is a religiously mixed area and until Wednesday it was deemed safe because it had not been hit before. The dawn strike came without warning. “It was around 4 o’clock in the morning. We were asleep. We woke up because of a very strong thud. We couldn’t see anything in the beginning because of the smoke that was everywhere,” said a mother of two who lived in the building opposite. She had sought refuge in her uncle’s house in Aramoun after Israel started bombing Beirut’s southern suburbs. “Israel is striking everywhere. There is nowhere that is safe anymore,” she added.\n\nEPA The Israeli military has not yet said who or what it targeted in the residential building\n\nAnother woman in her 80s was being rushed to a car. She had moved to Aramoun a month ago, also from Beirut’s southern suburbs. After the strike, she left with everyone else in the building and spent two or three hours in their car on the street. When we saw her, she was collecting some of her possessions. She told us she was very scared and was moving once more. This time, she said, she was going to her son’s place. He is displaced as well.

Satellite photographs show new trenches and earth berms dug over the past few months along the length of what is known as the Area of Separation (AoS). The BBC has filmed construction taking place alongside a military vehicle near the town of Majdal Shams, and fresh earthworks in rural land further south. The work in both locations is believed to lie within Israeli-controlled areas. The UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) says most of the Israeli construction does not breach the AoS, but that some trenches - dug under protection from military vehicles including tanks - do cross into it, and that Israeli army vehicles and personnel have also entered the buffer zone.\n\nBernard Lee of UNDOF told the BBC\'s Lucy Williamson that two major lines of trenches had been dug\n\nBeneath the watchtower at UNDOF’s Camp Ziouani base, the Israeli fence snakes towards a line of volcanic mountains; a Syrian flag flutters in the trees beyond the post, marking the other side of the separation zone. UNDOF observers monitor the 80km (50-mile) long strip of land 24 hours a day. Chief of Mission Bernard Lee told the BBC that two major lines of trenches had been dug, along with three more limited ones, each some 6m (20 ft) wide. He estimated that trenches crossed into the AoS in a handful locations, by a couple of metres in each case, but said he had not visited the sites himself. UNDOF was not able to immediately share visual evidence of the reported incursions, and permission for the BBC to view or film the locations from a nearby observation post has so far not been granted. Initial searches of satellite photographs have not produced images in enough detail to independently confirm the UN allegations.\n\nThe AoS was set up as part of Israel’s ceasefire agreement with Syria in 1974, following Israel’s earlier occupation of the Golan Heights. Israeli forces are required to be west of the so-called Alpha Line, while Syrian forces must be east of the Bravo Line, which runs along the other side of the AoS. Israel unilaterally annexed the Golan in 1981. The move was not recognised internationally, although the US did so unilaterally in 2019. Israeli settlers there live alongside about 20,000 Syrians, most of them Druze, who stayed on in the Golan after it was captured. Despite the presence of Iran-backed militia groups in Syria, this frontier has remained relatively calm, as Israeli ground forces have battled Iranian allies in Gaza and Lebanon over the past 13 months. But UNDOF said in a statement that the Syrian authorities had “strongly protested” the ongoing Israeli work. And that the UN itself had “repeatedly” taken its concerns over the Israeli violations to Israel’s military authorities. Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) spokesman Lt Col Nadav Shoshani told the BBC that the trenches were designed to protect against infiltration by Iran-backed groups in Syria - and did not break the ceasefire agreement. “Israeli officials have been communicating with the UN about these issues,” he said. “And I can tell you that the IDF is operating on Israeli territory making sure that a terror invasion is not possible, making sure we are defending our borders.”\n\nThe Israeli military said the trenches were designed to protect against infiltration by Iran-backed groups in Syria\n\nThe threat of a surprise invasion by Israel’s neighbours has loomed larger here since the 7 October Hamas attacks. “Will [the trenches] stop what happened on 7 October? Yes,” said Bernard Lee. “Could you get a pick-up truck over it? No.” But the defences being built along this frontier don’t address the more immediate threat from drones and missiles regularly launched by Iranian militia groups in Syria and Iraq – and frequently shot down by Israeli forces. Nor do they address Israel’s concerns about Syria being an “oxygen line” for Iran to smuggle weapons to its Lebanese ally, Hezbollah. Mr Lee said commercial smugglers already used the AoS to smuggle cigarettes and electronics between Syria and Lebanon. And that a new patrol road, built by the UN, is assisting them. “They come over the mountain, enter the area of separation with a trail of pack horses, eight at a time, with two armed guys,” he said. “They unload the pack horses and a pick-up truck meets them at our road: we’ve motorized the smuggling business.” Asked whether the same route could be used to take weapons from Syria into Lebanon, he replied: “That is what the IDF are concerned about.”\n\nUNDOF observers monitor the 80km (50-mile) long Area of Separation 24 hours a day\n\nIsrael has also pointed to what it says are “daily” violations along the demilitarized frontier by Syria. In May, Israel’s ambassador to the UN wrote to the secretary-general to complain about Syrian violations, including “armed presence in the area of separation” which “only heighten tensions in our already volatile region”. Iran-backed militia in the area are a concern for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, too, after years of civil war. It has appeared unwilling to be drawn in to the Israel-Hezbollah war, despite frequent Israeli strikes inside Syria targeting Hezbollah and Iranian positions and weapons shipments.\n\nEco-lodge owner Farhat says the Israeli works along the buffer zone give people a "sense of security"'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Russia sends military instructors to Equatorial Guinea', 'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30pjv8vp80o', 'authors': [], 'language': 'en', 'description': 'Up to 200 Russians are estimated to have arrived in the country in the recent past.', 'publish_date': None, 'feed': 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml'}, page_content='Russia sends military instructors to Equatorial Guinea - reports\n\nThe presidents of Equatorial Guinea and Russia met in September\n\nRussia, which has been seeking to gain more influence in Africa, has in recent years sent thousands of mercenaries to West and Central Africa to protect military regimes and help them fight insurgents.\n\nReports of Russian troops deployed in the country first surfaced in August.\n\nMedia reports say that the Russians are training elite guards in the country’s two main cities – the capital Malabo and Bata.\n\nRussia has reportedly sent up to 200 troops to Equatorial Guinea to protect the presidency, as it continues to expand its presence in Africa.\n\nThe Reuters news agency quoted sources saying that between 100 and 200 Russians were estimated to have arrived in the past two months.\n\nIt said some were likely to be part of the Corps Africa, a paramilitary force previously known as Wagner before being renamed and officially coming under Russian military control.\n\nThere have been other reports of sightings of the mercenaries in both Malabo and Bata, also indicating that they were there to protect the president and his family.\n\nThe tiny country with a population of 1.7 million is led by President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, the world’s longest-serving president who has been in power since 1979.\n\nHis son, Teodoro Obiang Mangue, who is known for his lavish lifestyle, is the country’s vice-president.\n\nHe has been at the centre of scandals around the world, and has been the subject of criminal charges and sanctions.\n\nThe Equatorial Guinean administration has faced criticism for its human rights record, including arbitrary killings and torture, according to a US government report.\n\nThe country has been trying to broker military deals as well as gas and mineral exploration agreements with Russia and Belarus.

On Wednesday, the Spanish-language musical is released worldwide on Netflix as the film awards race continues to heat up ahead of the Oscars in March. Selena Gomez, Zoe Saldaña, Karla Sofía Gascón and Adriana Paz launched the movie at the London Film Festival last month, where it continued to build its momentum. Emilia Pérez follows a dangerous Mexican Cartel leader (played by Gascón), who asks a high-powered lawyer named Rita (Saldaña) to help him fake his own death.\n\nBut the reason he wants to retire and disappear from the world of crime isn\'t what you might expect - the drug baron wants to change gender and live a new life as a woman. The rest of the film focuses on four women, including the newly-transitioned Emilia Pérez, as they each pursue their own version of happiness in modern-day Mexico. Pérez is portrayed by Spanish trans actress Gascón, who has been tipped as a possible best actress contender in the forthcoming awards race.\n\nNetflix Karla Sofía Gascón (left) plays the former drug lord who transitioned to being a woman\n\nFrench director Jacques Audiard came up with the idea for the film after reading a chapter in Boris Razon\'s 2018 novel Écoute about a drug lord who changes identity. Audiard went one step further for the film, and made it a story of changing gender. "I was less interested in a change of identity to evade competitor drug barons, and more interested in the change of identity for the sake of the person she was and is,” the director tells BBC News. "I was more interested in the past and what led to that transition." The role required someone very specific – a trans actress, who was a Spanish speaker, who could also sing and dance. Recalling the casting process, Gascón explains: “I was contacted when I was in Mexico by a production team, and was told \'We need an actress as crazy as you - you\'re the only one who can do this role, but you need to learn five songs for tomorrow!\' “And I was like \'OK, let\'s record the whole album and we\'ll go on tour as soon as you want!’" she jokes. “But I did say, ‘this is going to be difficult, I\'m not a singer\'. But the team in the film, they worked with me incredibly, they really helped me with all the songs and made it so that we could do the best work possible.” Asked about Gascón\'s casting, Audiard adds simply: “Without her, there would be no film.”\n\nGetty Images Karla Sofía Gascón plays the titular character in Emilia Pérez - a drug baron who changes gender\n\nInterestingly, Gascón campaigned to play both the male and female roles – in other words, the character both before and after transition. Audiard had originally intended for a different actor to play the male drug lord Manitas, because, the director explains, he was "uncomfortable asking [Gascón] to revisit something she was moving away from". But, Gascón recalled: “I said to Jacques, I want to play this role in the complete arc, because for me it is important to do the full part. It wouldn\'t be the same film if another actor played [Manitas]." That meant using effects and make-up such as a fake beard, so she could play the drug baron in the first section of the musical. "This film is this film because the same actress played the complete performance," Gascón continues. "It\'s that kind of role you have once in your life and I didn\'t want to lose the opportunity to play this.” The ongoing debate about whether actors should have lived experience of characters they play is complex, and Gascón herself says: "I prefer that all actors have the full opportunities. When you chose this career, it\'s because you want to express another life that\'s not like your life. "But," she continues, "obviously when you are closer to the role of the character, it\'s better. In this case, I think it\'s beautiful, because I give all of myself to this role." Gascón has been described as a "wonderful discovery" by the Hollywood Reporter\'s David Rooney, who said she gives "a magnificent performance". "The warmth, the joyous self-realisation, the complexity and authenticity... that illuminate her characterisation no doubt owe much to the parallels in the Spanish star’s life - in her own words, she was an actor before becoming an actress, a father before becoming a mother."\n\nGetty Images Selena Gomez was previously Emmy-nominated for her performance in TV series Only Murders In The Building\n\nGomez plays the drug lord\'s wife, who is kept in the dark about her former lover\'s new identity, while Paz portrays Emilia\'s new romantic interest after transitioning. Reviews of Emilia Pérez, which is released on Netflix next month, have been generally positive so far. "It\'s a wild, gritty, glitter-soaked ride that defies convention and classification," said Entertainment Weekly\'s Maureen Lee Lenker. She praised the film\'s performances, commenting: "Selena Gomez is a welcome surprise, shedding any remaining hints of her Disney Channel origins in her portrayal of a hard-loving wife of a narco. "The film\'s climax in particular allows Gomez to shine as a dramatic actress in new ways. She conveys heartache and anguish through a tortured physicality that propels her into the unpredictable state of a woman on the verge of something dangerous." Asked by the BBC\'s Graham Norton if it was comfortable going back to the world of singing and dancing for the musical, Gomez said: "No, because this was completely different. "It was intricate dance moves I never knew my body could do, and it was also me playing a character so if anything I tried to avoid what I was comfortable with."\n\nGetty Images US actress Zoe Saldaña has previously appeared in Avatar and Guardians of the Galaxy\n\nGetty Images Mexican actress Adriana Paz plays the love interest of the newly transitioned Emilia\n\nThe Telegraph\'s Tim Robey described the film as "amazingly confident – it’s clever, earnest, ridiculous, knowing, forceful and absolutely bonkers", while Hoai-Tran Bui of Inverse said it was "an emotionally fulfilling triumph". Not all critics were as enthusiastic about the film, however. "Emilia Pérez was originally intended to be an opera, which perhaps partly explains its saccharine sentimentality, repetitive lyrics, and diverging story branches. But that doesn’t excuse its almost random, whiplash-inducing tonal pivots," said Slant\'s Kyle Turner. However, Lauren Bradshaw of Fangirl Freakout said: "Emilia Pérez is a magnificent, genre-bending thrill ride that transcends the typical movie construct, breathing a fresh burst of excitement into the way we think about film."\n\nGetty Images The movie musical is directed by French filmmaker Jacques Audiard\n\nNetflix Selena Gomez plays the drug lord\'s wife, who is kept in the dark about his change of identity\n\nAs an actress, Gomez is best known for starring in Only Murders in the Building, but also has a successful singing career with hits including Back To You, Wolves and Love You Like a Love Song. Her co-star Saldaña, meanwhile, has starred in a large number of blockbusters in the last two decades, with roles in the Avatar and Guardians of the Galaxy franchises. It remains to be seen whether Emilia Pérez could be a big awards player, but Academy voters may see an opportunity to recognise Saldaña\'s box office success via this more critically acclaimed work.

Audrey F told the court in Paris how she had tried to stop a row spiralling out of control that began with a 13-year-old student lying to her parents. What began with Samuel Paty giving a lesson on freedom of expression in October 2020 escalated when the father of the girl, who had not even been in the class, turned up at the headteacher\'s office with a local Islamist activist. "I didn\'t manage to protect him," Audrey F said of her late colleague - a well-liked history and geography teacher in the Paris suburb of Conflans-Sainte-Honorine.\n\n"It\'s such an enormous waste." The row tragically ended with Paty\'s murder outside the school by 18-year-old Abdoullakh Anzorov, who was shot dead by police at the scene. Trial begins over beheading of French teacher\n\nBeheading of teacher deepens divisions in France The girl, known in court by the initial Z, had just been suspended by the school for two days for repeated absence and rudeness. That was not what she had told her parents. The girl claimed she had confronted Paty in a class she had not attended, falsely alleging that he had told Muslim students to leave the room while he showed "naked" images of the Prophet Muhammad. Although the mother of another girl had phoned the school in tears, Audrey F said she had called her back, with Samuel Paty also on the call, and said the mother appeared reassured. In reality, three cartoons published by a French satirical magazine had been discussed in class, and Paty had said anyone who felt they might be offended did not have to stay. Any depictions of the Prophet Muhammad are considered highly offensive by Muslims. But there had been no attempt to target or exclude Muslims students. The following morning, Audrey F was told that the excluded student\'s father Brahim Chnina was outside the school with another man, Abdelhakim Sefrioui, who wrongly claimed to be acting on behalf of French imams.\n\nThe pair were demanding action against Paty, who they condemned as a "thug" and wanted removed. Audrey F said that while she had tried to focus the conversation on the girl\'s exclusion from school, Abdelhakim Sefrioui had taken the lead, refusing to allow freedom of expression to be used by a "thug". The murder of Samuel Paty, 47, shocked France and came five years after militant Islamist gunmen murdered 12 people at the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo which published the original cartoons. Abdelhakim Sefrioui and Brahim Chnina are accused of identifying Samuel Paty as a "blasphemer" in online videos and of involvement in a "criminal terrorist" group and complicity in "terrorist murder".\n\nBENOIT PEYRUCQ/AFP Eight people are being tried in Paris and all deny involvement in the murder'), Document(metadata={'title': "US says Israel hasn't breached its law against blocking aid in Gaza", 'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgej83z93qo', 'authors': [], 'language': 'en', 'description': 'Officials say Israel has taken some steps to meet a US demand for more supplies to enter Gaza, but aid agencies say conditions have actually worsened.', 'publish_date': None, 'feed': 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml'}, page_content="US says Israel hasn't breached its law against blocking aid in Gaza\n\nDespite the US claims, the UN has warned that the amount of aid getting into Gaza is at its lowest level in a year.\n\nState Department spokesman Vedant Patel cited the opening of a new land crossing, and deliveries resuming in the north - although he did not say any had entered the besieged Jabalia refugee camp.\n\nOfficials said on Tuesday that Israel has taken a number of steps to address its demands to surge supplies into Gaza, but added that more progress must be made.\n\nThe US says Israel has not breached American laws on blocking aid supplies, after a 30-day deadline it gave Israel to boost humanitarian aid access in Gaza or risk having some military assistance cut off lapsed.\n\nA UN-backed report recently warned that there was an imminent likelihood of famine in northern Gaza, where hardly any aid has entered in the past month.\n\nJoyce Msuya, the United Nations acting under secretary general for humanitarian affairs, said international crimes were being committed in Gaza.\n\nMs Msuya briefed council members at the United Nations on Tuesday, reporting that Israeli authorities were blocking humanitarian assistance from entering North Gaza, where fighting continues.\n\nShe said 75,000 people remain there with dwindling supplies.\n\nLast month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken gave Israel 30 days to ensure more aid trucks reached Gaza daily.

More than 2,000 were launched in October, according to Ukraine’s general staff - a record number in this war. The same report says Russia fired 1,410 drones in September, and 818 in August - compared with around 1,100 for the entire three-month period before that. It’s part of a wider resurgence for Russian forces. The invaders are advancing all along the front lines. North Korean troops have joined the war on Moscow’s side. And with the election of Donald Trump for a second term as US president, Ukraine’s depleted and war-weary forces are facing uncertain support from their biggest military donor. The majority of the Russian drones raining down on Ukraine are Iranian-designed Shaheds: propeller-driven, with a distinctive wing shape and a deadly warhead packed into the nose cone. Russia has also started to launch fake drones, without any explosives, to confuse Ukraine’s air defence units and force them to waste ammunition. Compared to missiles they are much cheaper to build, easier to fire, and designed to sap morale.\n\nEvery night, Ukrainians go to sleep to notifications pinging on their phones, as inbound drones crisscross the country, setting sirens blaring. And every morning, they wake to news of yet another strike. Just since the start of November, drones have hit Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia. On Sunday, Russia launched 145 drones at Ukraine, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky - a record number for a single day since the start of the full-scale invasion. Kyiv said that day it had managed to shoot down 62 drones, and that a further 67 were “lost” - meaning they were either downed by electronic warfare, or disappeared from radar screens. Ukrainian air defences are struggling to cope with the surging numbers.\n\n“So far we have been intercepting them. I hope we will keep intercepting them,” Sgt Mykhailo Shamanov, a spokesperson for Kyiv city military administration, told the BBC. While he says Russia tries to hit military installations, the “general aim is terrorising civilians”. They know the Russians will continue to ramp up these attacks, he said – it’s why his government is constantly asking for more air defence from Western allies. It’s also why Ukraine is nervously waiting to see how US President-elect Trump will approach the war when he re-enters office. “Even if air defence works well, drone or missile debris falls on the city. It causes fires, damage and unfortunately sometimes victims,” he explained. “Every night it’s a lottery – where it hits, where it’s shot down, where it falls and what happens.”\n\nBBC/Kamil Dayan Khan Vitaliy's mobile defence unit defends the skies around Kyiv\n\nVitaliy and his men have no fixed post – their weaponry for shooting down the Shaheds is carried on the back of a flatbed truck, allowing them to manoeuvre quickly. “We try to monitor, move, outpace the drone, destroy it,” he said. It’s clear the job is taking its toll. “Half a year ago, it was 50 drones a month. Now the number has risen to 100 drones, every night,” he said. Their days are getting longer too. When the Russians used mainly missiles to bomb Ukraine, the unit commander said, the air alerts would last about six hours. “Now, it’s around 12 or 13 hours,” he said. Vitaliy is confident in front of his men, declaring that they can handle all that the Russians can fire at them if they get weapons from Western allies. “Our guys could even deal with 250 drones [in a night],” he said. But air defence can only do so much. Ukrainians will continue to suffer until Russia stops its invasion and its air assaults on cities.

Jet condensation trails, or contrails, have spawned wild conspiracy theories alleging mind control and the spreading of disease, but scientists say the real problem is their warming effect. Researchers argue these smoky trails essentially double the amount of heating that’s caused by aviation's use of fossil fuels. The problem will be discussed at the UN climate conference, COP29, in Baku for the first time.\n\nContrails form in the sky in the same way that your breath goes misty on a chilly morning. When a plane passes through cold humid air, the contrails form as the vapour from the engines condenses on unburned fuel fragments in the exhaust stream. While the causes of contrails have been known about for decades, it’s only in recent years that the climate warming impact of these human generated clouds has been recognised. “They create an artificial layer of clouds, which traps the heat from the Earth that’s trying to escape to outer space,” said Carlos Lopez de la Osa, from the Transport & Environment campaign group, which has carried out a new study on the solutions to contrails. “The scale of the warming that's associated with them is roughly having a similar impact to that of aviation carbon emissions.”\n\nConspiracy theories have grown up around contrails, with some people alleging they are in fact “chemtrails” that contain chemical or biological substances. The aim of these chemtrails is either vaccinating the population, spreading pandemics or controlling the minds of the masses, the conspiracy theories go on to claim. All of these ideas are completely untrue. “It is unfortunate that these conspiracy theories are muddying the water on an issue where we need a lot of consensus, a lot of clarity,” said Matteo Mirolo, from Breakthrough Energy, and one of the organisers of the COP29 discussion about the contrails. “Chemtrails are an unfounded theory. There's simply no scientific backing.”\n\nThe COP event aims to draw attention to the fact that relatively simple changes to aviation practice could eliminate much of the warming impact of these trails. According to the Transport & Environment study, some 80% of the warming associated with contrails is generated by just 3% of flights. Tweaking the flight paths of a handful of aircraft could reduce contrail warming by more than half by 2040, at a cost of less than £4 per flight. Geography and a flight's latitude have a strong influence on whether a contrail is warming. Flights over North America, Europe and the North Atlantic region accounted for more than half of global contrail warming in 2019, the report said. Time of day also influences the climate effects of contrails. Those formed by evening and night flights have the largest warming contribution. Seasonality is also important - the most warming contrails tend to occur in winter. “Planes are already flying around thunderstorms and turbulence areas,” Mr Lopez de la Osa said. “We will need to add one more constraint to flight planning, which is avoiding areas of contrail formation.” “Of the climate solutions which are being discussed at COP29, it's arguably one of the simplest ones.” The researchers are hoping that by holding this event at COP they will spread awareness of the problem and the solutions. They point to the huge amounts of money and research going into developing sustainable aviation fuels. They believe that tackling contrails could achieve a major win for the climate, at a fraction of the cost."), Document(metadata={'title': 'Israeli strikes in two Mount Lebanon villages kill 23', 'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86q5qeqxldo', 'authors': [], 'language': 'en', 'description': 'The strikes reportedly destroyed residential buildings where displaced families were living.', 'publish_date': None, 'feed': 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml'}, page_content='Israeli strikes in Mount Lebanon villages kill 23, ministry says\n\nEPA A residential building near Baalchmay was destroyed by one of the Israeli strikes\n\nAt least 23 people have been killed in Israeli air strikes on two houses in central Lebanon where displaced families were reportedly living, the Lebanese health ministry says. Fifteen people, mostly women and children, were killed in Joun and eight others were killed near Baalchmay. Both villages are in the Mount Lebanon region and outside areas where the armed group Hezbollah has a strong presence. The Israeli military said it was looking into the strikes, which came after it hit what it said were a number of Hezbollah targets in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Meanwhile, two people were killed by Hezbollah rocket fire in the northern Israeli town of Nahariya.\n\nIt came a day after Israel’s defence minister ruled out a ceasefire with Hezbollah until its war goals were met. The Israeli military went on the offensive against Hezbollah - which it proscribes as a terrorist organisation - after almost a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza. Israel says it wants to ensure the safe return of tens of thousands of northern Israeli border area residents displaced by rocket attacks, which Hezbollah launched in support of Palestinians the day after its ally Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. More than 3,200 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, including 2,600 in the seven weeks since Israel launched an intense air campaign followed by a ground invasion in the south, according to the Lebanese health ministry. Another 1.2 million people have been displaced.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the Israeli military carried out at least 10 strikes on Beirut’s southern suburbs, known as Dahieh, after issuing evacuation orders for 11 locations. Lebanese media reported that several buildings were levelled, including a medical centre in the Bir al-Abed area, but there were no reports of casualties. The Israeli military said it struck Hezbollah targets, including command centres and weapons production sites. In the evening, the Israeli military declared that it had “dismantled a majority of Hezbollah’s weapons storage and missile manufacturing facilities” that had been “systematically concealed beneath civilian buildings” in Dahieh. Most residents of Dahieh - one of the areas where Hezbollah has a significant presence, along with southern Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa Valley - have fled because their neighbourhoods have been targeted repeatedly since September. On Tuesday night, the Lebanese health ministry said 15 people were killed, including eight women and four children, in an Israeli strike on a house in Joun, in the Chouf mountains near the southern coastal city of Sidon. The state-run National News Agency reported that displaced families had been staying there. Residents and a security official said another house where displaced families had taken refuge was hit in Baalchmay, 30km (20 miles) to the north-east, killing eight people and injuring five. Wael Murtada told the Associated Press that the home had belonged to his uncle and that those inside had fled from Dahieh about 40 days ago. He said at least three children were among the dead. The targets of the two strikes were unclear. Elsewhere in Lebanon, five people were killed in a strike in the southern village of Teffahta, according to the health ministry. In the northern town of Ain Yaaqou, Lebanon’s Civil Defence agency said its first responders had recovered the bodies of 16 people, including four Syrian refugees, from the rubble of a residential building that was destroyed by an air strike on Monday night. The Israeli military said its forces had targeted a “military structure with a terrorist inside”.

Delhi and its neighbouring cities are experiencing pollution levels that are at least 30-35 times the safe limit recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Every year, Delhi and northern states battle hazardous air during the winter months of October to January due to plummeting temperatures, smoke, dust, low wind speed, vehicular emissions and crop stubble burning. This time, experts say that the condition is likely to get worse in the coming days.\n\nAccording to IQAir, a Swiss-based Air Quality Index (AQI) monitoring group, pollution levels in several parts of Delhi touched the 500 mark on Wednesday morning. AQI measures the levels of particulate matter, also called PM 2.5, in the air. These tiny particles can enter the lungs and cause a host of diseases. According to WHO guidelines, air with AQI values at or below 100 is considered to be satisfactory for breathing, while readings in the 400-500 range denote that pollution levels are "severe" in an area. The satellite cities of Noida and Gurgaon also registered AQI levels touching the 500 mark. Several northern states have been experiencing toxic air and poor visibility over the past few weeks. There have been reports of flights to and from Delhi being cancelled or delayed due to low visibility. So thick is the smog that it is visible even from space. A few days ago, Nasa shared satellite images of a blanket of smog engulfing parts of northern India and neighbouring Pakistan. The toxic air is also affecting people\'s health. A survey by LocalCircles, an online community platform, in Delhi and nearby cities revealed that 81% of families reported at least one member suffering from health issues due to pollution in the last three weeks. Over a third of respondents said they had purchased cough syrup during that time.\n\nAFP Commuters drive amid dense smog in Delhi on Monday morning\n\nThe Delhi government has enacted its Graded Response Action Plan - which bans all activities that involve the use of coal and firewood, as well as diesel generator use for non-emergency services - but that has not saved the city from experiencing toxic levels of pollution. Authorities have also urged residents to stay indoors as much as possible and to use public transport to cut vehicular emissions. Delhi was the most polluted capital city in the world in 2023, according to IQAir. India was also ranked as the world\'s third-most polluted country after neighbours Bangladesh and Pakistan, IQAir said. Air pollution is a serious problem in a number of Indian cities. Experts say that rapid industrialisation coupled with weak enforcement of environmental laws have played a role in increasing pollution in the country. India has seen a lot of development in the past few decades, but poor industrial regulation means that factories do not follow pollution-control measures. Rapid construction has also contributed to rising levels of pollution.'), Document(metadata={'title': 'What Trump could do on day one in the White House', 'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced961egp65o', 'authors': [], 'language': 'en', 'description': 'Trump has said he will "make heads spin" as he moves full-speed ahead after his inauguration.', 'publish_date': None, 'feed': 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml'}, page_content='What Trump could do on day one in the White House\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images Donald Trump at his first inauguration in 2017\n\nDonald Trump and his Republican Party have an ambitious agenda and control of US Congress. Trump has said he will "make heads spin" as he moves full-speed ahead after his inauguration on 20 January. His team has said to expect a flurry of executive orders - directives from the US president - out of the Oval Office in the first week. Policy experts and lawyers are already drafting those orders as part of the administration\'s transition. Still, advocacy groups and Democratic state governors have vowed to challenge at least some of those plans. Here is what the president-elect has said about his second-term priorities. Follow live: Trump transition updates\n\nImmigration and the border\n\nTrump press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News on Sunday "we know he promised to sign an executive order to secure the southern border". "We know that on day one he is going to launch the largest mass deportation of illegal immigrants in American history," she said. In the week since his re-election, Trump has prioritised filling leadership positions that would oversee immigration, suggesting he is preparing to tackle his plans for border policy early. He tapped veteran immigration official Tom Homan as his "border tsar"; selected South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem to oversee homeland security; and appointed Steven Miller as White House deputy chief of staff for policy. Mr Miller is best known for shaping some of Trump\'s most restrictive policies on illegal immigration during his first term. Any mass deportation programme could face logistical difficulties as well as a flurry of legal challenges from immigration and human rights activists. Trump could also re-implement his "Remain in Mexico" policy that required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while claims are processed. President Joe Biden had called the programme "inhumane" and tried to end it on his first day in office, but faced legal challenges. In 2022, the Supreme Court allowed him to move ahead. During the Trump administration, about 70,000 asylum seekers were returned to Mexico to wait for their hearings. Another day one promise was to end birthright citizenship - the 150-year-old principle that says anyone born on US soil is an American citizen. It\'s not clear how Trump plans to achieve this policy. He has pledged an executive order but birthright citizenship is explicitly guaranteed by the US Constitution, meaning it can only be altered under specific circumstances. He would need states to agree to a national convention or a two-thirds vote in favour in the narrowly split Congress to propose a change, then subsequent approval by three-fourths of state legislatures - of which Republicans control just over half.\n\n6 January\n\nTrump did not mention pardons in his victory speech, but he has long suggested that pardoning those convicted of storming the Capitol in 2021 would be a priority. "Oh, absolutely, I would. If they\'re innocent, I would pardon them," Trump said during a panel at the National Association of Black Journalists. US presidents have wide authority to forgive people convicted of federal crimes or end their prison sentences. Prosecutors may also decide to drop pending cases depending on who Trump might choose to pardon. What\'s less clear is who might get a pardon. At one point, Trump told CNN: "I am inclined to pardon many of them. I can\'t say for every single one, because a couple of them, probably they got out of control." Ms Leavitt told the Washington Post that he will decide “on a case-by-case basis when he is back in the White House”. More than 1,500 people were arrested in connection with the Capitol riot. According to federal numbers, more than 750 of them were sentenced for crimes ranging from trespassing to assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.\n\nJack Smith\n\nTrump has also faced his own legal challenges over his actions following the 2020 election and a separate classified documents case. Special Counsel Jack Smith, a veteran prosecutor appointed to oversee the US Department of Justice\'s investigations into Trump, filed charges, to which the president-elect has pleaded not guilty. This week, sources told CBS News that Mr Smith plans to resign before Trump takes office and avoid Trump\'s promises to fire him. The BBC\'s US media partner also reported that his office would wind down the two cases it was pursuing against Trump. It remains unclear whether Trump and his supporters will still try to punish Mr Smith. Congressional Republicans have reportedly implied they intend to investigate his work. "Jack Smith’s abuse of the justice system cannot go unpunished", billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk posted on social media. Trump had said firing Jack Smith is one of his top priorities. "I would fire him within two seconds. He’ll be one of the first things addressed," he said in an interview in October. Trump regularly railed against the special counsel in interviews and online, calling him a "crooked person", a "scoundrel" and other insults. Smith\'s cases were already facing an uncertain future. The Supreme Court ruled in July that presidents have partial immunity from criminal prosecution for their conduct in office, undermining Mr Smith\'s work. Trump\'s electoral win also gives him the power to pardon himself of any federal crimes, though no president has done so before.\n\nParis climate agreement\n\nIn his 2016 campaign, Trump made withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement a priority. Within six months of taking office, the United States moved to exit the landmark deal. President Joe Biden made rejoining the agreement one of his top priorities when he ran against Trump in 2020. Biden signed a letter requesting the US be readmitted on his first day in office. How will Trump respond in his second term? Media reports suggest that his team is preparing orders to withdraw once again when he takes office in January. Leaving the agreement would mean the US is no longer beholden to meeting set carbon emissions reductions. Among other priorities at odds with the Paris standards, Trump has said he wants to prioritise US production of oil and gas. He promised to quickly expedite permitting and fracking - "We’re drilling, drilling, drilling," he told Fox News host Sean Hannity last year. Trump has also criticised the Biden administration\'s plans to expand wind energy and increase electric car production, which could be early targets in his new administration.\n\nRussia and Ukraine\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump said he could end the war in Ukraine "in a day". He has also repeatedly criticised the US government\'s continued support of Ukraine, casting the war as a drain on resources. He has not yet given specifics on how he would negotiate the war\'s end beyond saying he would help the two countries strike a deal. Since his re-election, Trump has spoken to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a call that lasted "about half an hour", with billionaire Elon Musk also taking part. A source told the BBC that "it was not really a conversation to talk about very substantial things". The Kremlin denied that Trump held a call with Vladimir Putin, though media reports said Trump warned the Russian president against escalating the war in Ukraine.\n\nTrade and economy\n\nThe economy is an issue that Trump heavily campaigned on, vowing to end inflation as soon as he takes office. “We will target everything from car affordability to housing affordability to insurance costs to supply chain issues,” Trump has said. “I will instruct my cabinet that I expect results within the first 100 days, or much sooner than that.” He said he would sign an executive order that directs every cabinet secretary and agency head to “use every tool and authority at their disposal” to defeat inflation and to bring consumer prices down. Trump’s plan includes imposing tariffs on imported goods, especially those coming in from China, arguing that these taxes would keep manufacturing jobs in the US. It’s still unclear how widespread these tariffs will be, but Trump has raised the prospect of at least a 10% across-the-board tariff on imported goods, as well as a 60% import tax on goods from China. He also vowed to target Mexico with his tariffs. “I’m going to inform (the Mexican president) on Day 1 or sooner that if they don’t stop this onslaught of criminals and drugs coming into our country, I’m going to immediately impose a 25% tariff on everything they send into the US,” he has said. These tariffs would probably not need congressional approval. Trump already introduced tariffs in his first term, citing Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which empowers a president to impose duties on goods that could affect US national security. Another promise is to “end the Biden-Harris war on American energy”, Trump has said, vowing to ramp up oil drilling and fracking as a way to lower the cost of energy bills for consumers. Trump can do this with an executive order that rolls back environmental protections, which would allow him to halt clean energy projects and scrap climate targets set by the Biden administration. The president-elect has also vowed to fire Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, on day one. Gensler, who was appointed by Biden, pushed for climate disclosure rules and strong enforcement of the cryptocurrency market. Trump has championed cryptocurrency, and his election saw the value of Bitcoin go up by 30% in the past week due to an expectation that his administration will be more crypto-friendly.\n\nTitle X'), Document(metadata={'title': "Why is Elon Musk becoming Donald Trump's efficiency adviser?", 'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpqd4vw0ejeo', 'authors': [], 'language': 'en', 'description': 'The tech billionaire joins the incoming administration to "dismantle government bureaucracy" - but what\'s in it for both of them?', 'publish_date': None, 'feed': 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml'}, page_content='Why is Elon Musk becoming Donald Trump\'s efficiency tsar?\n\nWatch: Donald Trump and Elon Musk on the campaign trail\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk has been tasked with leading incoming President Donald Trump\'s new Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). In a statement on social media, the US president-elect said Musk - along with former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy - would "dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies". It is a role that the tech entrepreneur has arguably prepared for through his business leadership, and one he has spent months pushing for. But it is also one that is expected to garner him influence over government policy - and the regulatory environment facing his enterprises.\n\nRailing against regulation\n\nMusk has cast his plans to optimise government efficiency in heroic terms, pointing to his hopes of one day colonising Mars, while arguing that the feat would only be possible "so long as it is not smothered by bureaucracy". At the time, he said creating the new Doge was "the only path to extending life beyond Earth". Any major cuts to government agencies could also have potentially significant implications for his business interests, which are closely entwined with the government. Rocket firm SpaceX alone has more than $8bn-worth of ongoing contracts with the US government, according to public contracting sites, and could stand to benefit further from closer government ties. Meanwhile, his electric car company Tesla is facing investigations from numerous government agencies over issues such as the safety of its self-driving features. His desire to cut regulation could affect such probes. Musk in recent years has repeatedly accused regulators of launching trivial probes and standing in the way of his companies. In September he threatened to sue the Federal Aviation Administration over its plans to fine his SpaceX company $633,000 for alleged licence infringements related to some of its rocket launches from Cape Canaveral in Florida. He accused the agency of "regulatory overreach". Musk "stands to benefit personally from a lot of the deregulation that he touts," says Christopher Phelps, a professor of modern US political history, adding: "I think putting someone who is a billionaire and runs major corporations in charge of a federal project of deregulation is innately full of conflicts of interest." Others said Musk, who has long described himself as having a libertarian bent, appeared to be a true believer in the benefits of smaller government. "There’s no doubt that Musk has significant vested interests in the US regulatory landscape as a result of his many business enterprises," says Prof Gift. "At the same time, it’s hard to make the case that this is the only impetus driving him. "Musk has undertaken huge personal and political risks in coming out for Trump, and many of his activities and rhetoric seem to reflect an individual ideologically committed to causes he believes in." "Clearly he has got skin in the game and there’s a self-interest, but equally you can have a sincere belief that there is too much government regulation and too much government bureaucracy," says Alex Waddan, a professor of US politics at the University of Leicester.\n\nReuters Elon Musk says cutting red tape is "the only path" to colonsing other planets\n\nReward for loyalty\n\nFor years, Musk did not play a big role in politics, despite his large fortune, now worth more than $300bn, according to Forbes estimates. But he spoke out against the pandemic lockdowns of 2020. His criticism of the Biden administration mounted after the White House did not invite Tesla to an electric car summit in 2021. He formally endorsed Trump this year after an assassination attempt, ultimately donating a reported $200m (£157m) to Trump\'s 2024 presidential campaign and appearing at numerous rallies. Prof Phelps describes Musk\'s relationship with Trump as "transactional", adding that the new role "gives him a lot of symbolic clout - and possibly the clout to get the things that matter most to him done". As the South African-born billionaire is not a US citizen by birth, Musk cannot become president - something that has frustrated other famous faces who became involved in politics in the past. But he can have an influence on US policy, and Trump will have a sympathetic adviser to call upon. "Trump is looking to surround himself with loyalists in his new administration, and there’s no-one who’s been more loyal than Musk since he announced his endorsement for Trump," says Thomas Gift, a political science professor and director of the Centre on US Politics at University College London. "Not only did Musk go \'all in\' in supporting Trump personally and financially during the campaign, but he’s also evolved into a trusted adviser on topics as diverse as technology policy to the war in Ukraine." In an early sign of the influence the tech entrepreneur may be rewarded with for his loyalty, Musk was party to a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky following the election. The war in Ukraine will be a major foreign policy concern when Trump takes office. "That is actually quite extraordinary," says Prof Waddan. "Normally, even your biggest donors wouldn’t get that kind of access."\n\nWhat is the Department of Government Efficiency?\n\nGetty Images'), Document(metadata={'title': "What Trump's staffing picks tell us about his second-term plans", 'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2m1ey10rxo', 'authors': [], 'language': 'en', 'description': 'The contours and priorities of his new presidency are starting to take shape as he fills key positions.', 'publish_date': None, 'feed': 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml'}, page_content='What White House picks tell us about Trump 2.0\n\nGetty Images Trump chose Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, who has been critical of China in the past, to be US ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nA week after Donald Trump won a second-term in the White House, the contours of his new presidency have started taking shape. The president-elect has announced nearly a dozen appointees, the first steps toward filling out his White House staff and key government departments. He also made comments to the media and on social media that highlight what his priorities will be upon taking office in January, with a special focus on immigration and foreign policy. After a sometimes chaotic start to his first term, Trump is laying the groundwork for his next administration with a more clearly defined plan - and personnel ready to enact it. Here’s a look at what we’ve learned so far. Follow live: Trump transition updates\n\nA hard-line immigration team in place\n\nSome of Trump’s newly revealed appointments suggest that the president-elect’s campaign promise to deport millions of undocumented migrants living in the US is no exaggeration. Stephen Miller, who has been Trump’s close adviser and speechwriter since 2015, is Trump’s choice for White House deputy chief of staff for policy. He will likely shape any plans for mass deportations - and pare back both undocumented and legal immigration. During Trump\'s first term, Miller was involved in developing some of the administration\'s strictest immigration policies. Thomas Homan, acting director of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency in Trump’s first term, supported the president’s policy of separating undocumented families detained at the US-Mexico border. Now he’s back with an even broader portfolio, as Trump’s “immigration tsar”. “I will run the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen,” Homan said at a conservative conference in July. Critics have warned that Trump’s mass deportation plan could cost upwards of $300bn. In an interview with NBC News last week, however, the president-elect said cost was not an issue. “When people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries, and now they’re going to go back to those countries because they’re not staying here,” he said. “There is no price tag.” How would Trump’s promise of mass deportations of migrants work?\n\nChina hawks take flight\n\nMany conservatives believe that China poses the single greatest threat to continued US global dominance, both economically and militarily. While Trump has been more circumspect, limiting most of his China critiques to the realm of trade, he is filling his foreign policy team with vocal China critics. The president-elect picked Florida Congressman Mike Waltz, a retired Army colonel, as his national security adviser – a key foreign policy post within the White House. Waltz has said the US is in a “cold war” with China and was one of the first members of Congress to call for a US boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. In October, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, Trump’s pick for US ambassador to the UN, accused China of “blatant and malicious election interference” amid reports that China-backed hackers attempted to gather information from the former president’s phones. While Trump has yet to officially name his choice for secretary of state, Florida Senator Marco Rubio – another China hawk – appears to be the leading contender for the top diplomatic job. In 2020, Rubio was sanctioned by the Chinese government after he pushed measures to punish the nation for its crackdown on pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong. US-China relations were often rocky during Trump\'s first term, amidst trade disputes and the Covid pandemic. The Biden administration, which kept many of Trump\'s China tariffs and imposed some new ones, only somewhat calmed the waters. Now it looks like the next Trump administration will pick up where the last one left off. Who has joined Trump\'s team so far?\n\nTrump picks Musk to advise on how to \'dismantle\' bureaucracy\n\nMusk\'s new role\n\nWhile the list of Trump’s political appointees grows, there’s another group that stays small – and exceedingly influential. Elon Musk, the wealthiest man in the world, has been a full-time presence at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago transition headquarters. According to media reports, he is advising the president-elect on cabinet nominees and even joined a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week. On Tuesday night, Trump announced that he was assigning Musk to work with tech entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy in a "department of government efficiency" tasked with identifying new budget cuts. Musk has regularly offered his political opinions on his social media platform X, including endorsing Florida Senator Rick Scott’s bid to be the next Senate majority leader. Musk’s political action committee spent around $200m to help Trump’s presidential campaign, and he promises to continue to fund the group’s efforts to advance the president-elect’s agenda and help Republican candidates in upcoming congressional elections. Meanwhile, it remains to be seen where Robert F Kennedy Jr, another key figure, lands. Trump has said that he plans to give the former Democrat and vaccine sceptic, who abandoned his independent bid and endorsed the Republican, a role in making America “healthy” again. “He wants to do some things, and we’re going to let him go to it,” Trump said in his election victory speech.\n\nPrioritising presidential power over Congress\n\nAs Trump takes office, Republicans have control of the Senate and could still take the House, albeit by a slim margin. However, the president-elect’s early actions suggest he is more concerned with exercising his presidential power than working with the legislative branch. Last week, he posted on social media that the Senate’s Republican leadership should smooth the way for more presidential “recess appointments” – allowing him to fill top administration jobs without Senate approval when Congress is not in session. The move would strengthen presidential power by undercutting the chamber’s constitutional role to “advise and consent” on political appointees. Meanwhile, the president-elect keeps chipping away at those narrow congressional majorities. Senators who move to administration roles can quickly be replaced by appointment from the governor of their home state. But any House vacancies – such as ones created by Stefanik and Waltz’s departures – require special elections that can take months to schedule. Some of Trump’s advisers, including Musk, have warned that the president-elect could be endangering his legislative agenda if he plucks too many more Republicans from the chambers. Even in the best of circumstances, congressional legislation takes time, effort and compromise. Executive action, such as new immigration enforcement, can be done with the stroke of a presidential pen. Trump’s actions indicate he is, at least at the moment, more focused on the latter.\n\nRewarding loyalists\n\nTrump has only just begun filling out the thousands of jobs that open up with a new presidential administration, not including the senior-level career bureaucrats he has said he will replace. In 2016, as a political newcomer, he had to rely on more establishment Republicans for key roles. This time, he has a wealth of prospective candidates with proven track records of supporting him and after eight years, Trump loyalists are the Republican establishment. On Tuesday, Trump named South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as homeland security secretary, and Fox News host and conservative author Pete Hegseth as defence secretary. The latter has been particularly controversial, given his lack of experience navigating the sprawling US military bureaucracy and penchant for inflammatory remarks. For Trump, however, status as an outsider and a willingness to lean into hot-button cultural issues are a strength, not a flaw. And above all else, Hegseth and Noem have been fierce Trump defenders from the start. Some of Trump’s other picks, like Rubio and Stefanik, were critics of Trump early in his first presidential bid, but they have now spent years demonstrating that their harsh words are a thing of the past. Rubio, who ran for president against Trump in 2016, may still have White House ambitions, however. Trump often soured on appointees who seemed drawn to the limelight during his first term, and even the warmest of relationships could go bad. Trump may be placing a premium on loyalty with his early staff announcements, but the pressures of governing ultimately will reveal whether his second four years in office end up different from his first.'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Pete Hegseth: Trump names Fox News host as defence secretary pick', 'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c937ndxvkggo', 'authors': [], 'language': 'en', 'description': "Hegseth, who is also a former soldier without political experience, will lead the world's most powerful military.", 'publish_date': None, 'feed': 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml'}, page_content='Trump names Fox News host Pete Hegseth as defence secretary pick\n\nGetty Images\n\nUS President-elect Donald Trump has named Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host, author and military veteran, as his pick for defence secretary. Hegseth, 44, who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, will be responsible for the world\'s most powerful military in his first political role. Announcing his choice on Tuesday, Trump described him as "tough, smart and a true believer in America First". The news came on the same day Trump announced another political newcomer, billionaire Elon Musk, would take a government cost-cutting role.\n\nTrump\'s administration is taking shape after his win in last week\'s presidential election. Hegseth was one of a flurry of security appointments that also included Trump\'s pick of John Ratcliffe to head the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). If confirmed for his role by the US Senate, Hegseth will arrive at the Pentagon with decisions to make on issues such as military assistance for Israel during its campaign in Gaza, and on support for Ukraine in the face of Russia\'s invasion. Trump wants the US to disentangle itself from foreign conflicts generally. During the election campaign, he criticised the Biden administration\'s expenditure to support Kyiv.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Trump confirmed that he wanted South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem to play a significant role as homeland security secretary. Another military veteran, Michael Waltz, was chosen by Trump as national security adviser - meaning he will advise the president on foreign threats. Senator Marco Rubio - who shares Waltz\'s hawkish views on China - is expected to be Trump\'s future secretary of state, sources have told the BBC\'s US partner, CBS News. But the pick is not yet confirmed. Republicans have won back control of the Senate, the upper chamber of Congress, and are inching towards a majority in the House, the lower chamber, as vote-counting continues. Some of the government appointments - including Hegseth\'s - require a vote of approval by senators, although Trump, also a Republican, has demanded that the next leader of the US Senate let him bypass this process. He can give out other jobs directly. Senate Republicans are due to vote on a new leader on Wednesday - the day that Trump is also expected to visit the outgoing president, Joe Biden, at the White House as part of the traditional transfer of power.\n\nWho is Pete Hegseth?\n\nBorn in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Ivy League graduate Hegseth has in recent years worked as a conservative commentator. He lives with his wife and seven children in Tennessee. He has hosted programmes on Fox News, using his platform to draw attention to military and veterans\' issues. He had his last day at Fox on Tuesday. He is reported by US media to have successfully lobbied Trump during his first presidency to pardon servicemen accused of war crimes. In his statement announcing Hegseth as his pick for defence secretary on Tuesday, Trump highlighted the former soldier\'s education at Princeton and Harvard universities, and his military experience in Afghanistan and Iraq. "With Pete at the helm, America’s enemies are on notice - our military will be great again, and America will never back down," Trump wrote in a post. The president-elect also drew attention to Hegseth\'s work as a published author. He said the book The War on Warrior "reveals the leftwing betrayal of our warriors, and how we must return our military to meritocracy, lethality, accountability, and excellence".\n\nWhat has he previously said about the military?\n\nHegseth has been an outspoken opponent of what he has referred to as "woke" policies within the US military and its leadership. "The dumbest phrase on planet earth in the military is our diversity is our strength," Hegseth said on a podcast this month. One of his tasks as defence secretary could be to act on Trump\'s campaign promises to get rid of US generals who he accuses of pursuing progressive policies in the force. Before his selection by Trump, Hegseth was asked on the same podcast about what changes he would make in the military. He referred to "first of all" firing the US\' top military officer, Gen Charles "CQ" Brown Jr, saying people involved in diversity, equality or inclusion policies had "got to go". "Either you\'re in for war fighting and that\'s it, that\'s the only litmus test we care about," Hegseth told the Shawn Ryan Show, in an episode released last week. Gen Brown is a former fighter pilot with command experience in the Pacific and Middle East, and was appointed into the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff role by President Joe Biden last year. On the same podcast, Hegseth also said "whatever" combat standards were in 1995, "let\'s just make those the standards".\n\nWhat has the reaction been?\n\nHegseth\'s pick has been welcomed by a number of prominent Republican figures, but other reactions have been more varied. North Carolina senator Thom Tillis told Associated Press the choice was "interesting", and Senator Tommy Tuberville, of Alabama, said he would "have to think" about what he thought of the appointment. Incoming national security advisor Waltz said Hegseth "has the grit" to make "real reform" happen at the Pentagon. Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said the job "should not be an entry-level position". Posting on X, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said the appointment of Hegseth as defence secretary would "make us less safe and must be rejected". "A Fox & Friends weekend co-host is not qualified to be the Secretary of Defense," she added. "I lead the Senate military personnel panel. All three of my brothers served in uniform. I respect every one of our servicemembers."'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Jan 6 rioters expect Trump will keep pardon promise', 'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0jen70m88o', 'authors': [], 'language': 'en', 'description': 'Several Capitol riot defendants have asked for hearings to be delayed in anticipation of pardons.', 'publish_date': None, 'feed': 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml'}, page_content='\'Man of his word\': Jan 6 rioters expect Trump will keep pardon promise\n\nReuters\n\nOut of all of Donald Trump’s supporters, Derrick Evans has a particular reason to be happy with November’s election results – he hopes the president-elect will give him a pardon for participating in riot at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. “A pardon will be life changing,” said Evans, who was a member of the West Virginia legislature when he and at least 2,000 others stormed Congress. It was part of an effort to overturn the results of the US election, inspired by the false belief that it was Trump, not President Joe Biden, who had won. He reached an agreement with prosecutors which saw him plead guilty to civil disorder and spent three months in federal prison in 2022. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly said he would pardon the rioters, whom he has called “patriots” and “political prisoners”. But who exactly might be pardoned - and when - is still an open question. “I believe he\'s a man of his word,” Evans told the BBC. Seven things Trump says he will do in power\n\nWhen does he become president again?\n\nWhat happens to his legal cases now\n\nHow he pulled off an incredible comeback In March, Trump wrote on his Truth Social account that one of his first acts as president would be to “Free the January 6 Hostages being wrongfully imprisoned!” He repeated the pledge at a National Association of Black Journalists forum in Chicago in July. "Oh, absolutely, I would,” he said. “If they\'re innocent, I would pardon them." But he has stopped short of proposing a blanket pardon, at one point telling CNN: "I am inclined to pardon many of them. I can\'t say for every single one, because a couple of them, probably they got out of control." His campaign has previously said decisions would be made “on a case-by-case basis when he is back in the White House”.\n\nArrests still being made\n\nThe events of 6 January resulted in one of the largest federal investigations in US history. Nearly 600 people have been charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding police officers. Some of those who have been given the longest sentences, such as Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and Enrique Tarrio, leader of the Proud Boys, did not participate in the violence inside the building. Instead, they were convicted of seditious conspiracy and other felonies for organising the melee. Arrests are still being made. In an update issued last week, the FBI said it is still looking for nine suspects wanted for violent assaults on police officers. But with Trump coming back to the White House, the future of the investigation remains uncertain. Citing justice department sources, NBC News reported that officials are focusing on trying the “most egregious” cases before Trump’s inauguration on 20 January.\n\nDelayed hearings\n\nIn the meantime, several Capitol riot defendants have asked for hearings to be delayed in anticipation of pardons. Among them are Christopher Carnell, a North Carolina man who was found guilty of several riot-related charges earlier in the year. His lawyers asked for a hearing to be delayed last week because of possible "clemency actions relevant to his case”, but the request was turned down. Jonathanpeter Klein, who along with his brother Matthew pleaded guilty to several charges in July, asked for his sentencing hearing, scheduled for 15 November, to be delayed. That request, too, was turned down. A lawyer for Joe Biggs, a member of the Proud Boys who was handed one of the longest riot-related sentences, told reporters that he would be asking Trump for a pardon. Biggs was sentenced to 17 years in prison in 2023 after being convicted of crimes including seditious conspiracy, intimidation or threats to prevent officials from discharging their duties, and interference with law enforcement during civil disorder. During the riot, Biggs and others led a group of Proud Boys, tearing through barriers and barging into the Senate chamber. At trial, Biggs and others argued they were merely following Trump’s orders. His lawyer, Norman Pattis, told reporters in Florida that he would be seeking a pardon from the Trump administration. Wendy Via, co-founder of the not-for-profit Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), said that there is already a sense of excitement among rioters and their supporters. “Folks on fringe sites are calling for the release of what they are calling the Jan 6 ‘prisoners of war’ or ‘hostages’,” she said. They include Jake Lang, who is charged with a number of crimes including assaulting police officers, and who regularly posts online from his jail cell in New York. After Trump’s victory he wrote on X: “IM COMING HOME!!!! THE JANUARY 6 POLITICAL PRISONERS ARE FINALLY COMING HOME!!!!” “In just 75 days on January 20th 2025, when Donald J Trump is inaugurated as the 47th President of the United States, he will pardon all of the J6 Hostages.”\n\nLaying low\n\nGPAHE also found that some groups plan to lay low until Trump takes office and pardons are made official. One post on a Proud Boys channel on Telegram suggested that members avoid the January inauguration: “Stay home or patronize your local watering hole and celebrate the inauguration of our President and the imminent release of our Boys.” In a blog post, Via said pardons would “make a mockery of our justice system, and it will send the message to his followers that violence is a legitimate response to political outcomes they don’t like”. For the moment, the release of everyone charged with riot-related offences seems unlikely, but non-violent offenders such as Derrick Evans have called for large numbers to be freed. And, he suggested, a pardon would not be enough to compensate him and others for the time they spent behind bars. “I think there needs to be some reparations and restitution involved as well,” he said.'), Document(metadata={'title': "Tom Homan: How will the 'border tsar' approach immigration?", 'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75l1r0qv0po', 'authors': [], 'language': 'en', 'description': 'Homan has described the US border as "the biggest national security vulnerability" the nation has seen since 9/11.', 'publish_date': None, 'feed': 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml'}, page_content='How will Trump\'s new \'border tsar\' approach immigration?\n\nWatch: New \'border tsar\' Tom Homan discusses his approach\n\nVeteran immigration official Tom Homan will be in charge of the country\'s borders following Trump\'s inauguration in January. With a decades-long career in law enforcement and at the border, all eyes will be on how he plans to cut down on illegal immigration into the US - a flagship policy of Trump\'s election campaign. So how will he approach the task?\n\nHoman - an ex-policeman and former acting US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) director - has described immigration at the US border as "the biggest national security vulnerability this nation has seen since 9/11 and we have to fix it." Addressing illegal immigrants in the US during the Republican National Convention in the summer, he said: “You better start packing now.” But it is not yet clear how his role as "border tsar" will take shape, as managing immigration involves coordination among several government agencies. He has however, provided some ideas on how he would approach the border.\n\nReversing Biden policies\n\nIn an interview with CBS News\'s 60 Minutes in October, prior to Trump\'s election, Homan indicated he would seek to target non-criminal immigrants who are in the country illegally, after first prioritising "public safety threats" and "national security threats". Such an approach would reverse Biden administration policies that direct Ice to focus on deporting serious criminals, national security threats and recent border crossers. The current Biden policy helps protect undocumented immigrants who have been living in the US and have not committed crimes.\n\nTargeted arrests to facilitate deportations\n\nHoman has said he would use a targeted approach would be used when carrying out arrests and deportations. Asked in the same October interview how deportations would be carried out, Homan said: "It\'s not gonna be a mass sweep of neighbourhoods. It\'s not gonna be building concentration camps. I\'ve read it all. It\'s ridiculous." "They\'ll be targeted arrests. We\'ll know who we\'re going to arrest, where we\'re most likely to find \'em based on numerous... investigative processes," he added.\n\nDeporting families together\n\nHoman played a role in Trump’s controversial "zero tolerance" policy, which separated thousands of migrant children from their parents. The policy sparked backlash when children were sent to shelters while their parents were prosecuted with no plans to reunite them. Homan has said he didn’t write the policy memo that led to the separations, but he was one of three officials who signed it. He said he signed it “hoping to save lives”. Homan indicated that he would not seek to re-instate that policy. Rather, he has said families could be "deported together", when asked whether deportations could be carried out without separating families.\n\nWorkplace mass immigration arrests\n\nHoman also has pointed to reviving mass immigration arrests at workplaces - what he refers to as work-site enforcement operations, which Biden discontinued in 2021. “As far as the people going to push back on deporting, what is the option?,” he said on Fox News\'s Fox & Friends on Monday. “You have the right to claim asylum. You have a right to see a judge. We make that happen. But at the end of that due process if the judge says you must go home, then we have to take them home.”\n\nHoman’s roots as police officer, border patrol agent\n\nGetty Images'), Document(metadata={'title': "Who is Elise Stefanik, Trump's pick for UN ambassador?", 'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vlndv0yxpo', 'authors': [], 'language': 'en', 'description': "Stefanik has been critical of the UN for what she argues is a lack of sufficient support for Israel's war against Hamas.", 'publish_date': None, 'feed': 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml'}, page_content='Who is Elise Stefanik, Trump\'s pick for UN ambassador?\n\nGetty Images\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has named Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik to serve as the US ambassador to the United Nations.

While President Joe Biden will remain in office until January, this part of Florida has become a rival centre of political power in America. Just two years after an FBI raid found classified documents about US nuclear weapons and spy satellites stored in a bathroom, an eclectic mix of insiders are swarming to Mar-a-Lago, which is patrolled by robot dogs and armed guards on boats. North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, rumoured as a potential energy secretary, was there on election night. So was former US Defence Department chief of staff Kash Patel. Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, has been alongside Donald Trump in Mar-a-Lago during family dinners and calls with world leaders. Musk has been photographed inside the private club with his son and on the runway of Palm Beach International Airport, as he shuttles back and forth to be by the president-elect’s side.\n\nkaitrumpgolfs Donald Trump seen this week with his extended family - as well as Elon Musk who is holding his son, Techno Mechanicus\n\nFor those not blessed with an invitation to stay at Mar-a-Lago itself, the hotels and restaurants around nearby West Palm Beach are packed with office-seekers jostling for influence in the new administration and supporters celebrating Trump’s victory. Robert F Kennedy Jr, vaccine sceptic and scion of the one of the most famous US political dynasties, was by the swanky pool bar of The Ben hotel, where a fake ice rink and Christmas tree greet guests. Giant, golden Great Dane dog sculptures adorn the lobby and every floor outside the lifts. He is part of the transition team and the one-time presidential candidate is vying for a role with influence over health policy. Speaking even before the election, alongside the former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat-turned-Republican, he said: “There’s people of all different kinds of ideology and people that we’re going to have to go up against in that transition team and fight for our vision.”\n\nStephen Greaves/BBC News Golden Great Dane sculptures have been observing a parade of hopeful appointees at The Ben hotel\n\nAlso spotted at The Ben was outspoken Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia congresswoman who recently blamed the Biden administration for causing flooding in Republican areas of North Carolina. She is believed to be jockeying for a cabinet position. At The Breakers, an opulent Italian Renaissance-style oceanfront hotel, the young valets were most star struck by the visit of Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, who joined his friend Trump on stage on election night, but who says he has no personal political aspirations. The same cannot be said for others. One GOP insider that the BBC ran into in the corridors said the transition was “a free for all”, as different factions of the party battle for dominance. “Trump loves to see people scramble and suck up.” But the insider noted with a hint of worry that some “minimally acceptable people are starting to say they don’t want a role”. Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, for one, has conveyed that he isn’t interested in working in the administration and would prefer a Senate leadership position.\n\nStephen Greaves/BBC News The Mar-a-Lago compound, which includes Donald Trump's Florida home, is heavily fortified\n\nDonald Trump is expected to focus less on elected officials to fill senior positions. His son, Don Jr, said during an interview on Fox News that he wants people who “don’t think they know better” than his father and that he’s prepared to block anyone he thinks would be a disaster. The president-elect has been vocal about doing things differently this time around, feeling his biggest mistake during his first presidency was hiring “bad people, or disloyal people”. Back in 2016, plans for the transition that had been prepared by former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in concert with the outgoing Obama administration were laid to waste. Once the Trump team won what was seen as an improbable victory, they decided on an unconventional approach and fired Christie. What ensued was an Apprentice-style parade of people to Trump Tower in New York that played out in front of the cameras. Back then, news crews packed into the lobby to capture everyone headed up the golden elevator to see Donald Trump on the 26th floor. While the world was still trying to understand what a Trump presidency would look like, those with influence in Wall Street, media, politics and entertainment all sought an audience, including Bill Gates, Al Gore and even Kanye West.\n\nGetty Images The media captured every visitor to Trump Tower back in 2016\n\nThis time around, Trump seems to be prioritising loyalty, tallying up who has been with him since day one. And the world’s media are crammed onto hotel balconies and the parks and beaches surrounding Mar-a-Lago, where security is at fortress levels. The transition process is still unconventional by design, but so far it is far more behind the scenes than in 2016. Trump’s first appointment - Florida political consultant Susie Wiles as White House chief of staff - does offer one clue that a well-built Florida conservative political operation could be ready to replicate its success in the White House. Who is in the frame to join Trump's new top team? Slater Bayliss, co-founder of a Florida-based lobbying firm, Advocacy Partners, has worked both for and against Ms Wiles during election battles in the state and much prefers to be on her side. “I would say, borrowing a nickname from our friends across the pond, Susie is the Iron Lady of American electoral politics.” He says offers have been flooding in from talent across the state, which has served as a “stronghold of resistance for smart conservative thinkers who love our country and desire to play a role in making it more reflective of our electorate”. Republican political consultant Max Goodman says there is anticipation of a Florida wave crashing into Washington. He expects Trump’s team will be mining staffers in Susie Wiles’s team and in the state, whose congressional and Senate delegations came out early for Trump. “There is no hotter political farm system in the country than the state of Florida, when you have a president and the most prolific political consultant turned chief of staff calling Florida home,” he said.\n\nReuters Armed guards on boats patrol the waterfront resort\n\nDespite having the second largest Republican congressional delegation in the country, Mr Goodman says Florida has “notoriously been snubbed” when it comes to having a seat at the leadership table. He believes that could change with Ms Wiles leading the charge, and with key Floridians such as Rick Scott potentially in line as Senate Majority leader and Senator Marco Rubio in contention for a high-profile cabinet position. One person who has thrown his hand up to work in the transition is Joe Gruters, who is waiting to see how that shapes up. He was the 2016 co-chairman of Trump’s Florida campaign with Ms Wiles, then the chairman of the Republican state party, and is now a state senator. Mr Gruters describes himself as a “loyal foot soldier”, who was the only member of the Florida legislature to immediately endorse Trump’s 2024 bid and appear at Mar-a-Lago for his announcement. He is counting on Ms Wiles taking her “battle-tested” lieutenants up with her to Washington to fill out positions. “They know who the true believers are… and they probably have a clear idea of who they’re going to put in most of these positions,” Mr Gruters said.\n\nWatch: Robotic dog patrols Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence"), Document(metadata={'title': 'Democrats dreamt of an unbeatable coalition.

Why?', 'publish_date': None, 'feed': 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml'}, page_content='Democrats\' bet on a generation of liberal voters has backfired badly\n\nGetty Images\n\nDonald Trump swept to victory on Tuesday by chipping away at groups of voters which Democrats once believed would help them win the White House for a generation. After Barack Obama’s victory in 2008, many triumphantly claimed that the liberal voting coalition which had elected the first black president was growing more powerful, as the makeup of America changed. Older, white conservatives were reducing in number, and non-white Americans were projected to be in the majority by 2044. College-educated professionals, younger people, black Americans, Latinos and other ethnic minorities, and blue-collar workers were part of a “coalition of the ascendant”. These voters were left-leaning on cultural issues and supportive of an active federal government and a strong social safety net. And they constituted a majority in enough states to ensure a Democratic lock on the Electoral College – and the presidency. “Demography,” these left-wing optimists liked to say, “is destiny.” Sixteen years later, however, that destiny appears to have turned to dust. LIVE UPDATES: Trump projected to win Arizona\n\nCracks began forming when non-college educated voters slipped away from the Democrats in midterm elections in 2010 and 2014. They then broke en masse to Trump in 2016. While Joe Biden, with his working-class-friendly reputation built over half a century, won enough back to take the White House in 2020, his success proved to be only a temporary reprieve.\n\nThis year, Trump supplemented his gains with the blue-collar workers by also cutting into the Democratic margins among young, Latino and black voters. He has carved up the coalition of the ascendant. According to exit polls, Trump won: - 13% of the black vote in 2024 compared to Republican John McCain’s 4% against Obama - 46% of the Latino vote this time, while McCain got 31% in 2008 - 43% of voters under 30 against the 32% for McCain - 56% of those without a college degree - back in 2008, it was Obama who won a majority Speaking on Thursday after his comeback victory, Trump celebrated his own diverse coalition of voters. “I started to see realignment could happen because the Democrats are not in line with the thinking of the country," the president-elect told NBC News.\n\nImmigration and identity politics\n\nTrump did it with a hard-line message on immigration that included border enforcement and mass deportations – policies that Biden and the Democrats recoiled from when they took power back from Trump in 2021, lest they anger immigrant rights activists in their liberal base. Illegal border crossings reached record levels under the Biden administration, with more than eight million encounters with migrants at the border with Mexico. “If you watch a video from Hillary Clinton back in 2008 in the primaries, she talks about making sure there\'s wall-building, making sure that immigrants who violate the law get deported, making sure everybody learns English,” said Kevin Marino Cabrera, a Republican commissioner in Miami-Dade County. “It\'s funny how far to the left [the Democrats] have gone.” This week, Trump became the first Republican since 1988 to win that heavily Latino county in Florida. He also won Starr County in south Texas, with its 97% Latino population, with 57% of the vote. In 2008, only 15% of the county voted for McCain, the Republican. Mike Madrid, an anti-Trump Republican strategist who specialises in Latino voting trends, told the BBC that the problem with “demography is destiny” was that it risked treating all non-white Americans as an “aggrieved racial minority”. “But that is not and nor has it ever been the way Latinos have viewed themselves,” he added. “I hate that if you’re black, you\'ve got to be a Democrat or you hate black people and you hate your community,” Kenard Holmes, a 20-year-old student in South Carolina, told the BBC during the presidential primaries earlier this year. He said he agreed with Republicans on some things and felt Democratic politicians took black voters for granted.\n\nWith some states still tabulating their results, Trump currently has improved on his electoral margins in at least 2,367 US counties, while slipping in just 240. It wasn’t just the number of counties that Trump won that made a difference, either. Kamala Harris needed to post significant margins in the cities to offset Republican strength in rural areas. She consistently fell short. In Detroit’s Wayne County, for example, which the latest US Census reports is 38% black, Harris won 63% of the vote – significantly lower than Joe Biden’s 68% in 2020 and Obama’s 74% in 2008. Polls consistently suggested that the economy, along with immigration, were the two issues of highest importance to voters - and where polls indicated Trump had an advantage over Harris. His economic message cut across racial divides. “We\'re just sick of hearing about identity politics," said Nicole Williams, a white bartender with a black husband and biracial children in Las Vegas, Nevada – one of the key battleground states that Trump flipped this year. “We\'re just American, and we just want what\'s best for Americans," she said.\n\nUS voters on one reason Trump won... and why Harris lost\n\nThe Democratic blame game begins\n\nDemocrats are already engaged in considerable soul-searching, as they come to grips with an election defeat that has delivered the White House, the Senate and, perhaps, the House of Representatives to Republican control. Various elements within the party are offering their own, often conflicting, advice on the best path from the wilderness back to power. Left-wing Senator Bernie Sanders, who twice ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, also criticised identity politics and accused the party of abandoning working-class voters. Some centrist Democrats, meanwhile, have argued that the struggle to connect with voters goes beyond the economy and immigration. They point to how the Trump campaign was also able to use a cultural message as a wedge to fracture the Democratic coalition.\n\nAmong the positions that Republicans targeted in this year’s election were calls to shift funding away from law enforcement, decriminalise undocumented border-crossings and minor crimes like shoplifting, and provide greater protections for transgender Americans. Many arose after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 and the resulting rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as other efforts to advance social justice and acknowledge darker parts of American history. Within a few years, however, some of those positions proved a liability for Democrats when trying to win over persuadable voters and keep their coalition from fraying. Harris, for example, backed away from some positions she’d taken when she first ran for president in 2019.\n\nWhat does MAGA mean to these Trump supporters?\n\nIn the last month of the presidential campaign, the Trump team made the vice-president’s past support for taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for federal prisoners and detained immigrants a central focus. One advert ended with the line: “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.” The Trump campaign spent more than $21m on transgender issue ads in the first half of October – about a third of their entire advertising expenditures and nearly double what they spent on spots on immigration and inflation, according to data compiled by AdImpact. It’s the kind of investment a campaign makes if it has hard data showing an advert is moving public opinion. After Trump’s convincing win, Congressman Seth Moulton, a moderate from Massachusetts, said his party needed to rethink its approach on cultural issues. “Democrats spend way too much time trying not to offend anyone rather than being brutally honest about the challenges many Americans face,” Moulton told the New York Times. “I have two little girls, I don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I’m supposed to be afraid to say that.” Progressive Democrats, meanwhile, reject that characterisation, and argue that standing up for the rights of minorities has always been a core value of the party. Congressman John Moran wrote on X in response: "You should find another job if you want to use an election loss as an opportunity to pick on our most vulnerable.” Mike Madrid, the political strategist, has a brutal assessment of where the Democratic coalition is today. “The Democratic Party was predicated on what really is an unholy alliance between working-class people of colour and wealthier white progressives driven and animated by cultural issues,” Madrid said. “The only glue holding that coalition together was anti-Republicanism.” Once that glue came unstuck, he said, the party was ripe for defeat.\n\nFuture elections are sure to be held in a friendlier political environment for Democrats. And Trump, who has shown a unique ability to attract new and low-propensity voters to the polls, has run his last campaign. But 2024’s results will provide plenty of fuel for Democratic angst in the days to come. The Harris campaign itself believes she lost to Trump because she was facing a restive public angry over the economic and social turbulence in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic. “You stared down unprecedented headwinds and obstacles that were largely out of our control,” campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon wrote in a letter to her staff. “The whole country moved to the right, but compared to the rest of the country, the battleground states saw the least amount of movement in his direction. It was closest in the places we competed.” Moses Santana, a Puerto Rican living in Philadelphia, is from a demographic which seemed reliably Democratic a decade or so ago. But when he spoke to the BBC this week, he was not so convinced the Democrats had delivered when in power - or that their message today connected with Americans like him. “You know, Joe Biden promised a lot of progressive things, like he was going to cancel student debt, he was going to help people get their citizenship,” he said. “And none of that happened. Donald Trump is bringing [people] something new.” Additional reporting by Bernd Debusmann Jr and Brandon Drenon'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Watch: Moment Trump and Biden meet at the White House', 'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c8ek95kw8w4o', 'authors': [], 'language': 'en', 'description': 'The president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.', 'publish_date': None, 'feed': 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml'}, page_content='US President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump have met at the White House.\n\nBiden invited Trump to meet with him as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power as the government changes hands.\n\nIt’s the first time the pair have met since their presidential debate in late June, before Biden decided to end his re-election campaign.\n\nIn 2020, Trump refused to invite Joe Biden because he falsely claimed that he had not lost the election.'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Spain floods: Málaga street turns into river', 'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c238er1891ro', 'authors': [], 'language': 'en', 'description': 'Video shows people in Calle Alcazabilla struggling to cross a road as flood water surges through it.', 'publish_date': None, 'feed': 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml'}, page_content='Video captures the moment people in Málaga struggle to cross a road as flood water surges through it.\n\nFilmed at around 13:30 local time (12:30 GMT) the footage shows water gradually gathering speed as it gushes down a cobbled street in Calle Alcazabilla.\n\nSpain\'s Civil Protection Agency sent a mass alert to phones in Málaga province after 22:00 local time (21:00 GMT) on Tuesday evening warning of an "extreme risk of rainfall".'), Document(metadata={'title': "What a Republican trifecta means for Trump's second term", 'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cx28p40yv2zo', 'authors': [], 'language': 'en', 'description': 'Republicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.', 'publish_date': None, 'feed': 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml'}, page_content="Republicans have won control of the US House of Representatives less than a week after Donald Trump became the president-elect and the party also won the majority of seats in the Senate.\n\nBBC News Anchor Sumi Somaskanda explains what the party trifecta means for Trump's second term in office."), Document(metadata={'title': "'Taking revenge on society': Deadly Zhuhai car attack sparks questions in China", 'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpdv649vx7lo', 'authors': [], 'language': 'en', 'description': 'Many online are raising questions about a recent spate of public violence, as officials continue to censor discussion.', 'publish_date': None, 'feed': 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml'}, page_content='\'Taking revenge on society\': Deadly car attack sparks questions in China\n\nReuters Many have left flowers outside the sports centre in Zhuhai to mourn the dead\n\nA car attack that killed 35 people in China has sparked questions about a recent spate of public violence, as officials continue to censor discussion on the incident. On social media, many are discussing the social phenomenon of "taking revenge on society", where individuals act on personal grievances by attacking strangers. Police said the driver who ploughed into crowds at a stadium in the southern city of Zhuhai on Monday night acted out of unhappiness over a divorce settlement. While it is believed to be China\'s deadliest known act of violence in decades, it follows a string of attacks in recent months, including a stabbing spree at a Shanghai supermarket and a knife attack at a Beijing school.\n\nAmid a national outcry over the Zhuhai incident, President Xi Jinping has vowed "severe punishment" for the perpetrator. Police said the 62-year-old driver, who has been arrested, is in a coma due to self-inflicted wounds. On Chinese social media platforms, many expressed shock at his actions and asked if it was a symptom of deeper societal problems. One comment that went viral on Weibo read: "How can you take revenge on society because your family life is not going well? You\'ve taken the lives of so many innocent people, will you ever have peace of mind." “If there is a widespread lack of job security and huge pressure to survive... then society is bound to be full of problems, hostility and terror,” a user said on WeChat. Another person wrote in a widely-shared post: "We should be examining the deep-rooted, social [factors] that have fostered so many indiscriminate [attacks on] the weak." A number of violent attacks in China have been reported this year, including a mass stabbing and firearms attack in Shandong in February which killed at least 21 people. In October, a knife attack at a top school in Beijing injured five people, while in September, a man went on a stabbing spree at a supermarket in Shanghai, killing three people and injuring several others.\n\nReuters Some Zhuhai residents lit candles on Tuesday evening'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Watch: BBC China reporter pushed away from filming at car attack scene', 'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c78dvl7p79vo', 'authors': [], 'language': 'en', 'description': 'Watch: BBC China correspondent ordered to stop filming and pushed at car attack scene', 'publish_date': None, 'feed': 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml'}, page_content='At least 35 people have been killed in a car attack in southern China, believed to be the deadliest known act of public violence in the country in decades.\n\nPolice say a man crashed his car into a stadium in Zhuhai on Monday where he ran down groups of people exercising on the sports track.\n\nAt least 45 people - among them elderly and children - were reportedly injured.\n\nWhile reporting about the attack, BBC China correspondent Stephen McDonell was angrily ordered to stop filming.\n\nIt is not clear who the man who tried to stop the reporting was, though when sensitive stories like this unfold in China, local Communist Party officials organise groups of cadres to pretend to be outraged locals who have been given the role of targeting foreign reporters so as to prevent any coverage.\n\nRead more: Dozens killed in car rampage through Chinese stadium'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Quincy Jones, Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG: Inside the secret summit that hoped to end 1990s rap wars', 'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czr7pnx6d08o', 'authors': [], 'language': 'en', 'description': "Before Tupac's murder, producer Quincy Jones brought stars together to try to end violence in hip-hop.", 'publish_date': None, 'feed': 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml'}, page_content='Inside the secret summit that tried to stop deadly rap wars\n\nGetty Images Tupac Shakur was shot dead in 1996 at the age of 25\n\nBefore the east and west coast rap beef of the 1990s boiled over with the murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG, legendary producer Quincy Jones called a secret meeting at which he appealed for an end to the violence. As hip-hop rose from the streets to the mainstream in the 90s, the rappers and hustlers that broke through had few role models who had trodden that path before them. There was one man, though, who had been there, and done pretty much everything. Quincy Jones had been in gangs and had been stabbed at the age of seven in 1930s Chicago, before becoming a major force in American music thanks to his work with legends like Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson. He was at the heart of revolutions in jazz, swing, soul, funk, disco and pop - but one aspect of his career that got less attention when he died last week at the age of 91 was his place in hip-hop.\n\nMadison McGaw/BFA.com/Shutterstock Quincy Jones asked Fab 5 Freddy to be the moderator at his 1995 summit\n\nJones was revered in all corners of music, including rap. Unlike most in the old guard and the media, he immediately realised the scene\'s artistic and cultural importance. Hip-hop reminded him of the bebop jazz of his youth. "I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff," he said. "Quincy understood it and got it right away," says pioneering artist, rapper and presenter Fab 5 Freddy. Jones worked with leading rappers in the 80s, and in the 90s he recognised risks including a volatile rivalry that had begun to erupt between competing labels and stars. So he brought artists, executives and elder black American statesmen together for a secret summit in 1995, hoping it would be a turning point.\n\nGetty Images Notorious BIG was signed to P Diddy\'s Bad Boy Records\n\nThe east coast was hip-hop\'s spiritual home. In 1992, Sean Combs - then known as Puffy and later as P Diddy - launched his Bad Boy record label in New York with artists including Notorious BIG, aka Biggie Smalls. Meanwhile, across America, Los Angeles was coming into its own as the capital of gangsta rap, led by menacing mogul Suge Knight\'s Death Row Records, which had Dr Dre and Tupac. In 1994, Tupac was shot and injured during a robbery in the lobby of a studio. He later implied that his former friend Biggie may have known about the attack in advance. Biggie then released the track Who Shot Ya?, which Tupac thought was about him. The beef continued at the Source magazine awards on 3 August 1995, when Knight goaded Combs and Bad Boy Records from the stage. Jones, who had his own magazine, Vibe, held his summit three weeks later.\n\nThe brewing east-west beef wasn\'t the only reason Jones called it - it was mainly intended to discuss the state of hip-hop and let the new generation hear life and business advice from a group of highly successful black executives. But rap\'s negative image and the burgeoning tensions were a big talking point. "He knew this was a bubbling issue, and so his idea was to bring together a symposium," says Fab 5 Freddy, who was hosting Yo! MTV Raps at the time and was the event\'s moderator. Jones told the summit: "The thing that really provoked me to say it\'s time to pay attention now is Tupac." Tupac was missing, however - he was in jail for sexual assault at the time. Suge and Dre were there, as were Combs and Biggie.\n\nGetty Images Snoop Dogg, Dr Dre and Quincy Jones appeared at the 2004 Vibe Awards\n\nJones had already experienced his own beef with Tupac - the rapper criticised the producer in a 1993 edition of Source for marrying white women. "We finally hooked up, even though it was tension conditions in the beginning," Jones said at the event. "We finally talked to each other, and he said nobody had talked to him like that before. "And I said, I can\'t take it any more. Because we can no longer afford to be non-political, and I\'m talking to the hip-hop nation now."\n\nAlamy A 1994 issue of Jones\'s Vibe magazine had the headline "Is Tupac crazy or just misunderstood?"\n\nAbout 50 influential artists and executives were in the room, including Public Enemy\'s Chuck D, members of A Tribe Called Quest, MC Lyte, Kris Kross, Jermaine Dupri and Boyz n the Hood film-maker John Singleton. Jones wrote in his now-out-of-print 2001 autobiography: "I had been concerned about the potentially volatile diversity of a group who\'d never been in the same room together." They were joined by veteran executives Clarence Avant and Ahmet Ertegun, plus Colin Powell, the former national security adviser and head of the US military who would go on to become the first African-American secretary of state. Powell had presidential ambitions - that was why the summit was held in secret. Jones wanted to save Powell from being associated with the negative publicity that surrounded rap music. He switched venues at the last minute to throw press off the scent, and confiscated the recordings. "Rest assured that my discretion is based on a deep respect for you and a valued friendship," Jones wrote to Powell in an unpublished letter held at Indianapolis University Library. "I know that we are going to make a difference at this conference. Thanks for the way you handled the situation. Maybe we can turn the battleship an inch or two."\n\nGetty Images Quincy Jones and Colin Powell pictured in 2008\n\nJones later wrote in his book: "Some of the younger rappers didn\'t even know who he was. When addressing some of the more confrontational comments from the floor, Powell maintained his South Bronx demeanour and authoritative cool throughout." Fab 5 Freddy remembers one exchange between Powell and Knight. "There was an encounter where he [Knight] had something to say, and Colin Powell responded. "Here you have this guy who was a four-star general talking to Suge Knight, and he pretty much put Suge in his place." Jones finally released a clip of the event for a 2018 Netflix documentary about his life. "We\'ve got to seriously talk about what you are going to deal with," he is seen telling the assembled attendees. "They are not playing, there\'s real bullets out there, believe me. Maybe literally and figuratively. "It\'s a very emotional thing," he added, his voice cracking. "I want to see you guys live to at least my age." "Quincy did get emotional," Fab 5 Freddy recalls, "because he sensed what could happen. "And the worst, unfortunately, did happen."\n\nJones had ended up reconciling with Tupac. After Tupac\'s 1993 comments, Jones\'s 17-year-old daughter Rashida - who would go on to star in US sitcom The Office - wrote an irate letter to Source attacking the rapper. When Tupac bumped into one of Jones\'s other daughters, Kidada, he apologised, thinking she was Rashida. But Tupac and Kidada hit it off and began a relationship. "Though we got off to a rocky start, as I came to know and feel him I saw his enormous potential and sensitivity as an artist and as a human being," Quincy Jones wrote. There have also been claims that Tupac was planning to leave Death Row for Jones\'s record label. But in September 1996, a year after the summit, Tupac was shot and killed. A former gang leader, Duane "Keffe D" Davis, was charged with his murder last year. He has pleaded not guilty. Then in 1997, Notorious BIG was shot dead outside a party thrown by Jones\'s record label and magazine. No-one has ever been charged. Meanwhile, today Knight is in prison for a hit-and-run, while Combs is awaiting trial on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, which he denies.\n\nGetty Images Jones\'s daughter Kidada was in a relationship with Tupac when he died'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Beluga whale was Russian military asset', 'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1ml3n1x4zro', 'authors': [], 'language': 'en', 'description': "Marine scientist uncovers the story behind Andruha's escape from Russian military training programme.", 'publish_date': None, 'feed': 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml'}, page_content='Runaway \'spy whale\' fled Russian military training says marine scientist\n\nNorwegian Orca Survey The tame beluga whale approached Norwegian fishermen in 2019, wearing a harness, leading to speculation that it was an escaped Russian "spy whale"\n\nThe mystery as to why a beluga whale appeared off the coast of Norway wearing a harness may finally have been solved.

But Dr Shpak, who worked in Russia researching marine mammals from the 1990s until she returned to her native Ukraine in 2022, told BBC News: “For me it’s 100% (certain).” Dr Shpak, whose account is based on conversations with friends and former colleagues in Russia, features in a BBC documentary, Secrets of the Spy Whale, which is now on BBC iPlayer and being shown on BBC Two on Wednesday at 21:00 GMT.\n\nJørgen Ree Wiiig The beluga whale was wearing a harness which contained a mount for a camera\n\nThe mysterious whale first came to public attention five years ago when it approached fishermen off the northern coast of Norway. “The whale starts rubbing against the boat,” Joar Hesten, one of the fishermen, says. “I heard about animals in distress that instinctively knew that they need help from humans. I was thinking that this is one smart whale.” The sighting was unusual because the beluga was so tame and they\'re rarely seen as far south. It was also wearing a harness, which had a mount for a camera, and bore the words, in English, “Equipment St Petersburg”. Mr Hesten helped to remove the harness from the whale, which then swam to the nearby port of Hammerfest, where it lived for several months.\n\nOxford Scientific Films The harness the beluga was wearing had the words "Equipment St Petersburg" on it.\n\nSeemingly unable to catch live fish to eat, it charmed visitors by nudging at their cameras and even on one occasion returning a mobile phone. “It was very obvious that this particular whale had been conditioned to be putting his nose on anything that looked like a target because he was doing it each time,” says Eve Jourdain, a researcher from the Norwegian Orca Survey. “But we have no idea what kind of facility he was in, so we don’t know what he was trained for.” Captivated by the whale\'s story Norway made arrangements for the beluga to be monitored and fed. The name it was given – Hvaldimir - is a nod to hval which is Norwegian for whale, and the name of Russia\'s President, Vladimir Putin.\n\nOxford Scientific Films Dr Shpak says she is certain the beluga escaped from the Russian military programme but is not convinced it was a spy\n\nDr Shpak did not want to name her sources in Russia for their own safety but said she had been told that when the beluga surfaced in Norway, the Russian marine mammal community immediately identified it as one of theirs. “Through the chain of vets and trainers the message came back – that they were missing a beluga called Andruha,” she says. According to Dr Shpak, Andruha/Hvaldimir had first been captured in 2013 in the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia\'s Far East. A year later it was moved from a facility owned by a dolphinarium in St Petersburg to the military programme in the Russian Arctic, where his trainers and vets remained in contact. “I believe that when they started to work in open water, trusting this animal (not to swim away), the animal just gave up on them,” she says. “What I\'ve heard from the guys at the commercial dolphinarium who used to have him was that Andruha was smart, so a good choice to be trained. But at the same time, he was kind of like a hooligan - an active beluga - so they were not surprised that he gave up on (following) the boat and went where he wanted to.”\n\nGoogle Satellite images from near Murmansk in the Russian Arctic show what appear to be white whales in pens near a submarine base\n\nSatellite images from near the Russian naval base in Murmansk show what could have been Hvaldimir/Andruha’s old home. Pens can clearly be seen in the water with what appear to be white whales inside. “The location of the beluga whales very close to the submarines and the surface vessels might tell us that they are actually part of a guarding system,” says Thomas Nilsen, from Norwegian online newspaper The Barents Observer. Russia, for its part, has never officially addressed the claim that Hvaldimir/Andruha was trained by its army. But it does have a long history of training marine mammals for military purposes. Speaking in 2019, a Russian reserve colonel, Viktor Baranets, said: "If we were using this animal for spying, do you really think we\'d attach a mobile phone number with the message \'Please call this number\'?"\n\nThe beluga whale travelled south over several years'), Document(metadata={'title': 'US President-elect Donald Trump: Openings and warnings for Africa', 'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0jelzpngzo', 'authors': [], 'language': 'en', 'description': 'Analyst Alex de Waal looks at how the US president-elect could deal with conflicts on the continent.', 'publish_date': None, 'feed': 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml'}, page_content='Unconventional Trump brings openings and perils for Africa\n\nReuters\n\nIt is difficult to try to predict the decisions that US President-elect Donald Trump will make when he returns to the White House. But one thing seems unlikely to change: his dislike of patient, principled diplomacy as a means to peace and his preference for transactional politics and populist gestures. This brings openings and perils in some areas in Africa. Eight years ago, the Obama administration was working with the African Union (AU) to change United Nations (UN) rules for funding peacekeepers to put African missions on a firm financial basis. The AU Commission worked with the UN and other multilateral organisations to construct an "African peace and security architecture" that ranged from proactive diplomacy to avert looming conflicts through to coordinated mediation efforts and peacekeeping operations, all underpinned by norms and principles enshrined in the UN Charter and the AU Constitutive Act. How long ago that seems. Plans for more robust peacekeeping evaporated in the transition to the first Trump administration. Since then, no new UN or AU peacekeeping missions have been authorised. Several - including in Darfur, Sudan and Mali - have been closed, and others scaled down. The Biden administration did not reverse the trend. The idea of "liberal peace" - that peace, democracy, justice and open markets all go together - had long been a powerful strand in US global strategy. The AU embraced its multilateralism but recoiled from being lectured on human rights and democracy and were divided on Western military interventions such as in Libya. Some African leaders preferred Trump’s candour and focus on results. The "Trump Doctrine" for the Middle East and Africa swept aside multilateralism in favour of transactional deals with American allies in Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and, above all, Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and UAE President Mohamed bin Zayed set the strategy of the Abraham Accords, and Trump basked in the glory when Arab countries signed up. Trump’s other consistent positions were hostility towards China’s influence on the continent and aversion to deploying American soldiers.\n\nGetty Images Ethiopia\'s decision to build a huge dam on a tributary of the River Nile has caused tensions with Egypt\n\nAt the request of Egypt\'s President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - described by Trump as "my favourite dictator" - then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin took charge of mediating Egypt’s dispute with Ethiopia over the Nile waters. The immediate issue was how much water would be retained by the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam as it approached completion. As the talks faltered, Washington put its thumb on the scales, suspending aid to Ethiopia, while Trump suggested that Egypt might "blow up" the dam. America recognised Morocco’s claim over Western Sahara in exchange for Rabat signing the Abraham Accords and thereby recognising Israel. In the era of "liberal peace", an agreement to end a civil war was the drafting of a democratic constitution, along with measures for disarming and demobilising rival armies, transitional justice and reconciliation, and aid-funded programmes to deliver a peace dividend for the afflicted populace. The first Trump administration preferred direct deal-making, whereby autocrats cut a private bargain over the counter. Scholars call this the "illiberal peace". Trade, aid, security: What does Trump\'s win mean for Africa? When then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Sudan after the popular revolution that led to the ousting of military-Islamist ruler Omar al-Bashir, his main agenda was a simple trade: America would lift sanctions when Sudan agreed to sign the Abraham Accords. In October 2020, the White House announced that President Trump had "brokered a historic peace agreement" between Israel and Sudan. On the heels of deals with Bahrain and the UAE, and weeks before Americans voted in the presidential election, this was Trump’s "October surprise". It came too late to save Sudan from the economic crisis that crushed its democratic experiment and fell away after Trump lost to Joe Biden. But it’s fair to assume that the second Trump administration will continue this way. The exact alignments and deals are impossible to predict, and much will depend on the individuals appointed to key positions. But the "liberal peace" is now dead and buried. Sudan is currently Africa’s largest war and its biggest famine for decades. There is no sign that Trump is concerned.\n\nGetty Images The near-19-month conflict in Sudan has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced more than 11 million\n\nThe biggest obstacle to peace is that the UAE supports one side with weapons and cash while Egypt and Saudi Arabia back the other. There is no prospect for peace while this continues. For those Arab powerbrokers, Sudan is just one element in their geostrategic calculations, ranked below Israel-Palestine, Iran and relations with Washington. But if there is a reshuffle of the Middle Eastern political cards, a bargain over Sudan might be a by-product, even an opportunity for Trump to bask in the glow of an unexpected peacemaker. It will not bring an end to violence, let alone usher in democracy, but it would open the space for serious negotiations. A similar calculation holds for Ethiopia and its fractious relations with an Egypt-led coalition that includes Eritrea and Somalia. Along with an array of African leaders, Ethiopia\'s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is heavily reliant on Emirati largesse. Tensions in the Horn of Africa would be reduced if Egypt and the UAE align their strategies. The Biden administration\'s policy towards the Horn of Africa was neither committed to principled multilateralism, nor ready to use its leverage with the Gulf states. Its envoys could only grasp for minor wins such as pauses in the fighting or opening checkpoints for aid convoys. The tangled wars in Sudan, Ethiopia and their neighbours cry out for bold action - and if he were so minded, Trump might cut the Gordian Knot. But the risks of a conflagration are high. The Trump White House will not be likely to restrain bellicose tendencies by Middle Eastern powerbrokers or African leaders, and - especially during the US policy vacuum of the next few months - any one of those leaders could launch a war, confident that America will not respond. In his first term, Trump showed no interest in the US military footprint in Africa. Apparently on a whim, he ordered the withdrawal of American troops from Somalia, where they were involved in the war against the jihadist group al-Shabab - a decision reversed by the Biden administration. It’s unlikely that Trump will pay attention to the Pentagon’s operations against jihadists there or in the West African Sahel, unless there is a high-profile incident with American casualties. And America’s Middle Eastern allies will be keen for the US to retain its military base in Djibouti. Reports of collusion between Yemen’s Houthis and al-Shabab, heightening risks of attacks in East Africa or on shipping in the Indian Ocean, may rekindle US interest in military operations. Alternatively, missions could be outsourced to allies such as the UAE or private military contractors.\n\nAFP Relations between Kenya and the US strengthened under the Biden administration\n\nKenyan President William Ruto’s rapport with Biden will do him no favours, but Kenya’s new status as a "major non-Nato ally" - and contributor of police to Haiti - will likely retain good standing within the Department of Defense. West Africa is today the locus of the world’s most active jihadist movements as well as a tide of putschists who cut deals with Russia’s security outfit, the Wagner Group, now merged into its Africa Corps. If Trump sees West Africa through the prism of relations with Moscow, and his planned deal with President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine, it will introduce a wild card into the region’s politics. But tensions will arise because his ally, Morocco, has its own ambitions for strategic leadership across West Africa. It’s a major non-Nato ally and has been leery of Russian influence in Algeria, Libya and the Sahel - adding up to a mix that would be stirred if Trump cuts deals with Putin. Transactional politics imply cutting deals with coup leaders and warlords whose crimes are their credentials. AU principles such as outlawing unconstitutional changes in government will be disregarded. Nigeria\'s President Bola Tinubu may have preferred Biden, but he is familiar with Trump’s style of politics and will seek a formula for keeping America onside in its war against jihadist group Boko Haram. In February, just weeks after the presidential inauguration in Washington, Africa’s leaders will meet in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to elect a new chairperson of the AU Commission. The outgoing chairperson, Chad\'s former Prime Minister Moussa Faki Mahamat, was content to be a trader in the political bazaar of the Trump-Biden years. His successor will face the challenge that Africa’s best formula for peace and security lies in norm-based multilateral cooperation, but 2025 will be an inauspicious year for reviving that project.

That’s a question Dhananjay Yashwant Chandrachud, who retired as India’s 50th chief justice on Sunday, asked just weeks before he finished his term. Justice Chandrachud said his mind was “heavily preoccupied with fears and anxieties about the future and the past”. “I find myself pondering: Did I achieve everything I set out to do? How will history judge my tenure? Could I have done things differently? What legacy will I leave for future generations of judges and legal professionals?” he said. The soul searching came at a time when many in India are also debating what legacy he leaves behind. Justice Chandrachud served more than eight years as a top court judge and as chief justice for the past two years. He presided over one of the most powerful Supreme Courts in the world with jurisdiction over India’s 1.4 billion citizens. The top court is the final court of appeal, the final interpreter of the constitution and its judgements, which are binding on all other courts in India, routinely make news - although judges seldom do. But Justice Chandrachud, sometimes described as India’s “first celebrity judge” and a "rockstar judge", has routinely hit the headlines.\n\nPTI A viral video recently showed Justice Chandrachud praying at home with PM Modi during a Hindu religious festival\n\nAccording to Arghya Sengupta of the Vidhi Centre For Legal Policy, the jurist was India\'s most prolific chief justice who wrote 93 judgements - more than his last four predecessors put together – including some on matters of seminal importance. He also made huge strides in terms of digitisation and livestreaming of court hearings – making them more accessible to citizens. But some of the recent coverage has also been unflattering, with critics saying he wasn\'t assertive enough and his tenure has been disappointing. The Harvard-educated judge has many firsts to his name – he was the youngest to head a high court and his two-year-term was the longest for a chief justice in more than a decade. He’s also the only chief justice whose father also served in the role. During his years in the Supreme Court, he developed a reputation for being a progressive, liberal judge known for his nuanced and thoughtful judgements related to matters of liberty, freedom of speech and gender and LGBT rights. He was part of landmark rulings that decriminalised homosexuality and allowed menstruating women into Kerala’s Sabarimala shrine. His utterances on the right to privacy and right to dissent were extensively praised. So, his elevation to be India’s top judge in November 2022 was welcomed by senior lawyers, activists and citizens with many expressing a “strong hope that under his leadership the court will rise to greater heights”. It was a time when India’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government was getting ready to secure a third term in the 2024 general election. Opposition parties, activists and sections of the press were accusing the government of targeting them, with global rights organisations saying Indian democracy was under threat. Although the government denied any wrongdoing, many of India’s top academics, rights activists and popular opposition leaders found themselves in jail and the country kept sliding on the global press freedom index. (The government has always rejected such ratings, saying they are biased against India.)\n\nGetty Images Critics say the former chief justice - seen here with Home Minister Amit Shah - wasn\'t assertive enough with the government\n\nSenior lawyer Kamini Jaiswal says Justice Chandrachud’s appointment had come at “a crucial juncture as some of the last chief justices had left under a cloud of dark spots and the position had been denigrated with serious allegations”. “So, we thought Justice Chandrachud would use his erudition and brilliant mind to do a lot of good for the citizens. But he has been disappointing,” she said. Senior Supreme Court lawyer Chander Uday Singh says his record is “a mixed bag”. “In his judgments, he would lay down the law brilliantly which could be used as a precedent for future cases. But whenever the state was heavily invested in any issue, he failed to hold power to account, so the state got away with what they had set out of achieve.” For instance, he points out that the court struck down a government scheme that allowed people to make anonymous donations to political parties, calling it unconstitutional and illegal. “But then he did not hold anyone accountable for the illegality.” Similarly, when it came to a political crisis in the western state of Maharashtra or Delhi’s power struggle with the federal government, his judgments tended to favour the government, he adds. “There was hope that through his judgments, he would set things right in a country that is under a strong majoritarian government. But he fell short.”\n\nEPA A liberal judge, Justice Chandrachud is known for his nuanced and thoughtful judgements on gender and LGBT rights\n\nSeveral top lawyers have also criticised Justice Chandrachud for what he did as the “master of the roster” by failing to effectively prevent the prolonged incarceration of political prisoners - leading to the death of some of them without ever getting bail. This happened despite Justice Chandrachud saying that bail should be the norm and not the exception. And as he neared his retirement, Justice Chandrachud also made headlines for what he did not in the court, but outside. In September, there was uproar over a viral video that showed him praying at home with PM Modi during a Hindu religious festival. Ms Jaiswal said by publicising the photo, “a message was being sent that the chief justice is close to the PM”. Lawyers, former judges, opposition politicians and many citizens also criticised him saying “the presence of a politician at a private event erodes the perception of impartiality of the judiciary”. Another burst of criticism greeted Justice Chandrachud’s comment last month when he said he had asked God for a solution to the vexed Babri Mosque-Ram temple dispute. “I sat before the deity and told him he needed to find a solution and he gave it to me,” he said. The comment led to a firestorm of criticism, not entirely unexpected as the mosque-temple dispute has been one of the most contentious and religiously polarising issues in modern India. The mosque was demolished by Hindu mobs in 1992. A five-judge bench, which included Justice Chandrachud, ruled in 2019 that the demolition was illegal, but still gave the disputed land to Hindus and a separate site for the mosque to be built. Earlier this year, PM Modi inaugurated a grand new temple at the site, fulfilling a longstanding promise by his party. So, no surprise then that Justice Chandrachud’s comment, seen by many as religious, was extensively criticised.'), Document(metadata={'title': "Ghana election: Who are the candidates and what's at stake?", 'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd545m0qjqo', 'authors': [], 'language': 'en', 'description': 'In an echo of the US, the current vice-president is up against an ex-president in the 7 December vote.', 'publish_date': None, 'feed': 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml'}, page_content='Gold, prices, and jobs: What\'s at stake in Ghana\'s elections?\n\nAFP\n\nGhana is due to get a new president after December’s election. The current vice-president, Mahamudu Bawumia, and a former head of state, John Mahama, are the two leading candidates in contention to win the poll. Nana Akufo-Addo, first elected in 2016, is coming to the end of his second and final four-year term.\n\nWhen is the general election?\n\nOn Saturday 7 December, the nearly 18.8 million Ghanaians registered to vote will be able to take part in the country\'s ninth general election since multiparty politics was reintroduced in the early 1990s. In the last 30 years, the country has had a series of closely fought but peaceful polls. Ghana has a reputation for the orderly transfer of power between administrations.\n\nWhat are Ghanaians voting for?\n\nOn polling day, two elections will be taking place simultaneously: Presidential – there are 12 candidates\n\n– there are 12 candidates Parliamentary – voters in 275 constituencies across the country will be choosing their MP.\n\nWho will be Ghana’s next president?\n\nAFP Mahamudu Bawumia (L) and John Mahama (R) are the two leading candidates to replace Nana Akufo-Addo as president\n\nAlthough 12 hopefuls are vying for the presidency, only two have a realistic chance of winning. Since the return of multiparty politics in 1992 only candidates from either the National Democratic Congress (NDC) or the New Patriotic Party (NPP) have won. The two front-runners are: Mahamudu Bawumia (NPP) - Having served as Akufo-Addo’s vice-president for eight years, the 61-year-old Oxford-educated economist could make history as the country\'s first Muslim president. The former deputy governor of the central bank gained a reputation for his financial know-how. But that could also be his undoing as he has faced heavy criticism after Ghana plummeted into its most severe economic crisis in years under his watch.\n\n- Having served as Akufo-Addo’s vice-president for eight years, the 61-year-old Oxford-educated economist could make history as the country\'s first Muslim president.

John Mahama (NDC) – Winning this ballot would represent a comeback for the 65-year-old as he already served as president for four-and-a-half years from 2012 but then lost the 2016 election. In office, he was nicknamed “Mr Dumsor”, which is a reference to the power cuts that plagued his time in office. Amid the current tough economy, Mahama has pledged an “urgent reset” for the country that needs an experienced leader at the helm.

Alan Kyerematen – The former minister, nicknamed “Alan Cash”, left the NPP last year after complaining that the presidential primaries were biased against him. He could draw some NPP support in the party’s heartland in the Ashanti region.\n\nWhat are the big issues?\n\nEconomic questions have topped people’s concerns in the build-up to the election, especially the rising cost of living. At the end of 2022, the annual inflation rate hit 54%. It has come down since then but prices are still rising steeply. The World Bank said as many as 850,000 Ghanaians may have been pushed into poverty in 2022 because of the rising prices of goods and services. These "new poor" joined the six million who were already living in poverty. By the end of 2022, government finances had been depleted with little left to support the country’s budget, forcing Ghana to go to the International Monetary Fund for help. How Ghana\'s central bank lost $5bn in one year Unemployment among young people and an exodus of Ghanaians looking for better opportunities elsewhere has also been a feature of recent years. The NDC has decried this as an "abysmal performance" and has demanded a reset. The governing NPP says it has built a resilient economy that is on the "cusp of… transformation" so it is not the time to change. Concerns over the environmental impact of illegal gold mining – known in the country as “galamsey” – have become another major talking-point. A series of demonstrations over the practice, which has led to the pollution of several major rivers with dangerous chemicals, have been held in the build-up to the vote. Ghana gold rush sparks environmental disaster Both major parties agree that the issue needs to be addressed, but while the NPP says it is important for the economy to allow some small-scale miners to continue their work, the NDC is calling for much tougher regulation and the restriction of new licences.\n\nHow does the election work?\n\nAFP The last election in 2020 took place under covid restrictions\n\nTo win the presidential election in the first round, a candidate must get more than half of the votes cast. If no-one passes that threshold then a second round run-off featuring the two candidates with the largest number of votes will take place by the end of December. The parliamentary election is run on a first-past-the-post basis with the winner being the candidate in each constituency with the largest share of votes, even if that is less than 50%. On election day, each voter can turn up to their assigned polling station with their voter’s ID card, where they will have their fingerprints electronically checked and are then issued with the two ballot papers. Each person who has cast their ballot then has their little finger marked with indelible ink to prevent voting a second time.\n\nWhat has happened in previous elections?\n\nSince 1992, Ghana has had several tight presidential elections. In 2008, less than half a percentage point separated the two candidates in the second round. In the election four years later, the winner, Mahama, crept over the 50% threshold in the first round by less than 80,000 votes. That result triggered a legal complaint from the NPP, which argued that tally sheets at certain polling stations had been tampered with. The challenge was unsuccessful, but it did lead the electoral commission to introduce new measures to ensure greater transparency. Election observers have frequently praised the way the vote has been run.\n\nWhen will we know the result?\n\nGoing by previous elections, the electoral commission is likely to announce the result by 10 December.\n\nAdditional reporting by Favour Nunoo and Komla Adom in Accra\n\nMore BBC stories on Ghana:\n\nGetty Images/BBC'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Optimism and uncertainty as Middle East awaits Trump’s return', 'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czr71nr723no', 'authors': [], 'language': 'en', 'description': "As heads of Arab and Islamic states meet in Riyadh, Trump's victory raises questions for the region.", 'publish_date': None, 'feed': 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml'}, page_content="Optimism and uncertainty at summit as Middle East awaits Trump’s return\n\nFrank Gardner Trump had a warm relationship with Saudi Arabia during his first term in office\n\nAs leaders of dozens of Arab and Islamic nations gather in the Saudi capital for a summit, there is widespread speculation about what a second Trump presidency will mean for the region. In sharp contrast to the fears voiced in Europe about Donald Trump’s famous unpredictability, Gulf Arab countries tend to view him as a force for stability. Writing in the officially approved Arab News opinion column, the prominent UAE business leader Khalaf al-Habtoor says: “In a Middle East where security is paramount, Trump’s focus on strengthening alliances and curbing extremist forces offers a way forward.” Here in Saudi Arabia, Trump is viewed much more favourably than Joe Biden. Trump chose Riyadh for his first overseas trip as President in 2017, an idea reportedly brokered by Rupert Murdoch. Through his son-in-law Jared Kushner, Trump enjoys warm relations with the de facto Saudi ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known by his initials, MBS. The crown prince has never forgiven or forgotten Biden saying that Saudi Arabia needed to be made a pariah for its attitude to human rights.\n\nReuters Trump's previous administration brokered the historic Abraham Accords between Israel and several Arab League states\n\nTrump’s record in office is a mixed one when it comes to the Middle East. On the one hand he pleased Israel and upset the Arab world by recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital as well as Israel’s annexation of the occupied Golan Heights. But he also secured the Abraham Accords in 2020 which saw the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco establish full diplomatic relations with Israel and Sudan agree to do so. Trump was, and is, hawkish on Iran. In 2018, he pulled the US out of the Iran nuclear deal, the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Calling it “the worst deal in history”, he shared the views of many governments in the region that the deal, aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear ambitions, failed to tackle Iran’s ballistic missile programme while enriching the Revolutionary Guards with money then used to fund proxy militias around the region. In 2020, to Iran’s fury but to the satisfaction of many in the Gulf Arab states, Trump ordered the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the leader of the Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force. But today’s Middle East is not the same as the one when Trump left the White House. Israel is at war with Hamas and Hezbollah, and exchanged blows with both the Houthis in Yemen and their backers in Iran.

Beheadings, mass killings, child abuse, hate speech – all of it ends up in the inboxes of a global army of content moderators. You don’t often see or hear from them – but these are the people whose job it is to review and then, when necessary, delete content that either gets reported by other users, or is automatically flagged by tech tools. The issue of online safety has become increasingly prominent, with tech firms under more pressure to swiftly remove harmful material. And despite a lot of research and investment pouring into tech solutions to help, ultimately for now, it’s still largely human moderators who have the final say. Moderators are often employed by third-party companies, but they work on content posted directly on to the big social networks including Instagram, TikTok and Facebook.\n\nThey are based around the world. The people I spoke to while making our series The Moderators for Radio 4 and BBC Sounds, were largely living in East Africa, and all had since left the industry. Their stories were harrowing. Some of what we recorded was too brutal to broadcast. Sometimes my producer Tom Woolfenden and I would finish a recording and just sit in silence. “If you take your phone and then go to TikTok, you will see a lot of activities, dancing, you know, happy things,” says Mojez, a former Nairobi-based moderator who worked on TikTok content. “But in the background, I personally was moderating, in the hundreds, horrific and traumatising videos. “I took it upon myself. Let my mental health take the punch so that general users can continue going about their activities on the platform.” There are currently multiple ongoing legal claims that the work has destroyed the mental health of such moderators. Some of the former workers in East Africa have come together to form a union. “Really, the only thing that’s between me logging onto a social media platform and watching a beheading, is somebody sitting in an office somewhere, and watching that content for me, and reviewing it so I don’t have to,” says Martha Dark who runs Foxglove, a campaign group supporting the legal action.\n\nMojez, who used to remove harmful content on TikTok, says his mental health was affected\n\nIn 2020, Meta then known as Facebook, agreed to pay a settlement of $52m (£40m) to moderators who had developed mental health issues because of their jobs. The legal action was initiated by a former moderator in the US called Selena Scola. She described moderators as the “keepers of souls”, because of the amount of footage they see containing the final moments of people’s lives. The ex-moderators I spoke to all used the word “trauma” in describing the impact the work had on them. Some had difficulty sleeping and eating. One described how hearing a baby cry had made a colleague panic. Another said he found it difficult to interact with his wife and children because of the child abuse he had witnessed.

But they didn’t. What came across, very powerfully, was the immense pride the moderators had in the roles they had played in protecting the world from online harm. They saw themselves as a vital emergency service. One says he wanted a uniform and a badge, comparing himself to a paramedic or firefighter. “Not even one second was wasted,” says someone who we called David. He asked to remain anonymous, but he had worked on material that was used to train the viral AI chatbot ChatGPT, so that it was programmed not to regurgitate horrific material. “I am proud of the individuals who trained this model to be what it is today.”\n\nMartha Dark Martha Dark campaigns in support of social media moderators\n\nBut the very tool David had helped to train, might one day compete with him. Dave Willner is former head of trust and safety at OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. He says his team built a rudimentary moderation tool, based on the chatbot’s tech, which managed to identify harmful content with an accuracy rate of around 90%. “When I sort of fully realised, ‘oh, this is gonna work’, I honestly choked up a little bit,” he says. “[AI tools] don't get bored. And they don't get tired and they don't get shocked…. they are indefatigable.” Not everyone, however, is confident that AI is a silver bullet for the troubled moderation sector. “I think it’s problematic,” says Dr Paul Reilly, senior lecturer in media and democracy at the University of Glasgow. “Clearly AI can be a quite blunt, binary way of moderating content. “It can lead to over-blocking freedom of speech issues, and of course it may miss nuance human moderators would be able to identify. Human moderation is essential to platforms,” he adds. “The problem is there’s not enough of them, and the job is incredibly harmful to those who do it.”")]
